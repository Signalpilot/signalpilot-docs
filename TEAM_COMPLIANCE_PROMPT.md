## üö® Critical: This Guide is Mandatory for All Content Creation

All educational content, documentation, marketing materials, and code comments **must** follow these guidelines to maintain compliance and protect intellectual property.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ SIGNAL NAMING & DESCRIPTION (STRICT COMPLIANCE)

### The Golden Rule: ALL Signals Use "Indicates"

**NEVER use:** confirms, signals, detects, marks, shows, means, represents, signifies

**ALWAYS use:** "Indicates [condition]"

### Exact Signal Descriptions (Use These Verbatim):

#### Pentarch v8.9 Signals:

| Signal | Exact Description | ‚ùå WRONG | ‚úÖ CORRECT |
|--------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| **TD** (Touchdown) | Indicates early-cycle reversal conditions | "TD confirms a bottom" | "TD indicates early-cycle reversal conditions" |
| **IGN** (Ignition) | Indicates momentum breakout conditions | "IGN signals a buy" | "IGN indicates momentum breakout conditions" |
| **WRN** (Warning) | Indicates weakening momentum | "WRN warns of reversal" | "WRN indicates weakening momentum" |
| **CAP** (Climax) | Indicates late-cycle exhaustion conditions | "CAP marks the top" | "CAP indicates late-cycle exhaustion conditions" |
| **BDN** (Breakdown) | Indicates bearish breakdown conditions | "BDN confirms breakdown" | "BDN indicates bearish breakdown conditions" |

### Terminology Replacements:

- ‚ùå "Capitulation" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "Climax" (for CAP signal)
- ‚ùå "confirms" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "indicates"
- ‚ùå "tells you" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "shows you"
- ‚ùå "bottom/top" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "early-cycle/late-cycle"
- ‚ùå "always wins" ‚Üí ‚úÖ "is key" or "is important"

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ DIRECTIVE vs EDUCATIONAL LANGUAGE (COMPLIANCE)

**Problem:** Giving trading advice opens us to regulatory liability.

**Solution:** Use educational/informational language only.

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN Patterns (Trading Advice):

```
‚ùå "Enter on IGN"
‚ùå "Exit when CAP appears"
‚ùå "Set your stop below IGN"
‚ùå "DO NOT trade against HTF"
‚ùå "Take profit at resistance"
‚ùå "Wait for candle close"
‚ùå "You should..."
‚ùå "You must..."
‚ùå "Never trade without stops"
‚ùå "Always use 2:1 R/R"
‚ùå "Full exit when..."
‚ùå "Primary entry signal"
```

### ‚úÖ APPROVED Patterns (Educational):

```
‚úÖ "IGN is commonly used as a potential entry signal"
‚úÖ "Many traders consider exiting when CAP appears"
‚úÖ "Common stop placement: below IGN candle"
‚úÖ "Trading against HTF is associated with lower probability"
‚úÖ "Resistance levels are often used for profit targets"
‚úÖ "Many traders wait for candle close before evaluating"
‚úÖ "Traders often..."
‚úÖ "Common practice includes..."
‚úÖ "Trading without stops is generally considered high-risk"
‚úÖ "Many traders use minimum 2:1 R/R"
‚úÖ "Higher-conviction scenarios include..."
‚úÖ "Often used as a potential entry signal"
```

### Conversion Guide:

| ‚ùå Directive (Advice) | ‚úÖ Educational (Compliant) |
|----------------------|---------------------------|
| "Best practice:" | "Common usage patterns:" |
| "You should..." | "Many traders..." / "Typical approach..." |
| "Never do X" | "X is generally considered high-risk" |
| "Always do Y" | "Y is standard practice" / "Y is commonly used" |
| "Do this" | "This is often done" / "Common approach includes" |
| "Primary signal for..." | "Commonly used as..." / "Often used for..." |
| "Enter on IGN" | "IGN is typically used as a potential entry signal" |
| "Set stop at X" | "Common stop placement: X" |
| "Exit when CAP" | "CAP often triggers exit consideration" |
| "Wait for close" | "Many traders wait for close" |
| "Full exit when:" | "Higher-conviction scenarios:" |
| "Rules:" | "Common guidelines:" |

### Example Rewrites:

**BEFORE (Non-Compliant):**
```
### IGN Signal - Best Practice

‚úÖ Primary long entry signal
- Enter immediately on candle close
- Set stop below IGN candle
- Target resistance level
- DO NOT enter without HTF confirmation

Rules:
- Wait for candle close
- Minimum 2:1 R/R
- Never enter against HTF trend
```

**AFTER (Compliant):**
```
### IGN Signal - Common Usage Patterns

IGN is commonly used as a potential long entry signal
- Many traders evaluate after candle close
- Common stop placement: below IGN candle
- Resistance levels often used as targets
- HTF confirmation is typically preferred for higher-conviction setups

Common guidelines:
- Many traders wait for candle close before evaluating
- Minimum 2:1 R/R is often used
- Trading against HTF trend is associated with lower probability
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION (SECURITY)

**Problem:** Early documentation exposed complete implementation details that could enable reverse engineering.

**Solution:** Describe benefits and features, NOT technical specifications or algorithms.

### ‚ùå NEVER EXPOSE:

- Z-score methods or parameters (e.g., "¬±2œÉ around 20-SMA")
- Exact vote counts (e.g., "4-vote regime detection")
- Component counts (e.g., "3-component oscillator")
- Formula specifics (e.g., "winsorized Z-scores with 3√ó cap")
- Algorithm names (e.g., "FlipGuard Z-Gate 2.0")
- Performance specs (e.g., "168 security calls")
- Exact thresholds (e.g., "threshold = 0.237")
- Calculation methods (e.g., "uses RSI(14) + CCI(20) + MFI(14)")
- Weight distributions (e.g., "RSI weighted 40%, CCI 35%, MFI 25%")

### ‚úÖ APPROVED Language:

- "Advanced volume spike detection"
- "Multi-factor regime identification"
- "Composite momentum analysis"
- "Volatility-adaptive features"
- "Higher timeframe confirmation system"
- "Proprietary scoring algorithm"
- "Multi-dimensional analysis"

### Example:

**BEFORE (Exposed IP):**
```
Minimal Flow Elite Spike Detection:
- Uses Z-score method with ¬±2œÉ thresholds
- 4-vote regime system (optimized weights: 35/30/20/15)
- Winsorized Z-scores with 3√ó cap
- HTF confirmation via 3-timeframe vote system
- Requires 168 security calls per calculation
```

**AFTER (Protected IP):**
```
Minimal Flow Elite Spike Detection:
- Advanced statistical spike detection
- Multi-factor regime identification
- Robust outlier handling
- Higher timeframe confirmation system
- Optimized for performance
```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ REAL EXAMPLES FROM RECENT FIXES

### Example 1: Signal Description Fix

**BEFORE:**
```
### CAP (Capitulation)
Confirms that price has reached a top. Marks the end of the trend.
```

**AFTER:**
```
### CAP (Climax)
Indicates late-cycle exhaustion conditions.
```

---

### Example 2: Directive Language Fix

**BEFORE:**
```
#### CAP (Climax)

**Best practice:**
- ‚úÖ Exit or dramatically tighten stops on longs
- Consider partial profit-taking
- Move stop to protect profits

**Full exit when:**
- CAP at major resistance
- After extended run
- Against HTF downtrend
```

**AFTER:**
```
#### CAP (Climax)

**Common usage patterns:**
- Often used as exit consideration for long positions
- Many traders adjust stops or take profits
- Can be used to watch for BDN confirmation for shorts

**Higher-conviction CAP scenarios:**
- CAP at major resistance levels
- Following extended price moves
- Against higher timeframe downtrends
```

---

### Example 3: IP Protection Fix

**BEFORE:**
```
Minimal Flow v4.0:
- Elite spike detection (Z-score method with ¬±2œÉ thresholds)
- 4-vote regime detection (optimized weights)
- Winsorized Z-scores with 3√ó cap
- Volatility adaptation (HIGH/NORMAL/LOW thresholds)
```

**AFTER:**
```
Minimal Flow v4.0:
- Significant volume spike detection
- Multi-factor market regime identification
- Robust statistical methods
- Volatility-adaptive features
```

---

### Example 4: Psychological Section Fix

**BEFORE:**
```
### Discipline Rules

1. **Never trade without stop loss** - No exceptions
2. **Never move stop toward entry** - Only trail in profit
3. **Never increase position size after losses** - Revenge trading kills accounts
```

**AFTER:**
```
### Common Discipline Guidelines

1. **Stop loss usage** - Trading without stops is generally considered high-risk
2. **Stop management** - Moving stops toward entry increases risk; trailing in profit is more common
3. **Position sizing after losses** - Increasing size after losses (revenge trading) often leads to larger losses
```

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ WHEN IN DOUBT

**Ask yourself:**
1. **Am I telling someone what to do?** ‚Üí Convert to "Many traders do..." or "Common approach includes..."
2. **Am I describing a signal's meaning?** ‚Üí Use exact description from Section 1
3. **Am I exposing how we built this?** ‚Üí Describe the benefit, not the method
4. **Would a regulator consider this trading advice?** ‚Üí Rewrite as educational information
5. **Are Pilot Line, Nanoflows, and regime colors properly covered?** ‚Üí Add if missing
