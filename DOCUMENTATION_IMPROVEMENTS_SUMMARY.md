# Documentation Improvements Summary

## Overview

All 7 indicator documentation pages have been revised following safe, non-directive language guidelines while improving readability and flow.

---

## Core Improvements Applied to All Pages

### 1. **Structure Reordering**
- **OLD:** Theory → Features → Example → Settings → FAQ
- **NEW:** Core Function → Settings → Example → Features → Deep Dive → FAQ

**Why:** Users see what indicator does, configure it, see it working, THEN learn the details.

### 2. **Safe Language Patterns**
- ❌ Removed: "commonly used", "traders often", "you should", "best for"
- ✅ Added: "can be interpreted as", "appears when", "available for", "conditions detected"
- ✅ All examples include: "(Historical observation for educational purposes only. Not financial advice.)"

### 3. **Example Placement**
- Moved from Section 5-6 to Section 3
- Added clear disclaimers
- Removed outcome predictions

### 4. **Simplified Initial Descriptions**
- Technical details moved later in document
- Initial sections focus on "what you see" not "how it works"
- Progressive disclosure of complexity

### 5. **Standardized Section Names**
All pages now use consistent terminology:
- "Core Functionality" (not "What Does It Do")
- "Settings" (not "Configuration")
- "Educational Example" (with disclaimer)
- "FAQ" (not "Frequently Asked Questions")
- "Quick Reference" (not "Cheat Sheet")
- "Support" (consistent footer)

### Harmonic Oscillator v1.0 ADAPTIVE — 3-in-1 Momentum

**Core Issue:** "Democratic voting" concept buried, divergence feels like afterthought

**Key Improvements:**

**Section 1: Core Functionality**
```
Harmonic Oscillator combines three momentum indicators into single composite:
- MACD (trend strength)
- RSI (extreme detection)
- StochRSI (timing)

Democratic Voting System: Signals appear when 2 or 3 components agree.

Display: Single oscillator line (0-100 scale)
- Above 70 = Overbought zone
- Below 30 = Oversold zone

Three Signal Modes Available:
- Conservative: All 3 votes required
- Balanced: 2 of 3 votes required (default)
- Aggressive: 1 vote required

Works on all timeframes.
```

**Section 2: Settings**
```
Configuration Options:

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Signal Mode** | Conservative/Balanced/Aggressive | Balanced |
| **HTF Filter** | On/Off (uses 4× chart timeframe) | Off |
| **Divergence Detection** | On/Off | On |
| **Component Display** | Show individual oscillators | Off |

Mode Selection Guide:
- Conservative (3 votes): Fewest signals, highest confluence
- Balanced (2 votes): Moderate frequency, strong confluence
- Aggressive (1 vote): Most signals, frequent opportunities
```

**Section 3: Educational Example**
```
Educational Example: Ethereum (January 2025)
(Historical observation for educational purposes only. Not financial advice.)

Setup Observed:
- Price: $1,800, declining

```
Divergence Types Available:

Regular Bullish Divergence:
- Price: Lower low
- Oscillator: Higher low
- Label: "BULL DIV" (green)
- Interpretation: Downtrend weakening characteristics

Regular Bearish Divergence:

**Core Issue:** Opens defensively ("The Problem with Regular OBV"), too technical upfront

**Key Improvements:**

**Section 1: Core Functionality**
```
Plutus Flow analyzes On-Balance Volume (OBV) with adaptive smoothing.

OBV Concept: Cumulative volume indicator showing money flow direction.
- Rising OBV = Buying pressure accumulating

- Divergence detection included
- Signal labels for entry/exit points

Display: Bottom panel oscillator with trend overlay.
Works on all timeframes.

```
Configuration Options:

| Setting | Options | Default |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Smoothing Level** | 1-5 (1=raw, 5=very smooth) | 3 |
| **Trend Line** | On/Off | On |
| **Divergence Detection** | On/Off | On |
| **Signal Display** | Entry/Exit/Both | Both |

Smoothing Guide:
- Level 1-2: More signals, faster response
- Level 3: Balanced (default)
- Level 4-5: Fewer signals, cleaner trends
```

**Section 3: Educational Example**
```
Educational Example: S&P 500 (October 2024)
(Historical observation for educational purposes only. Not financial advice.)

Setup Observed:
- Price: 4,200 and rising

- Signal: Exit signal fired at 4,250

Outcome:
- Price declined from 4,250 to 4,100
- Divergence indicated weakening buying pressure
- -150 point move observed (3.5% decline)

Pattern: Price/OBV divergence preceded decline.
Individual interpretation and outcomes vary.
```

**Section 4: Signal Types**
```
Available Signals:

Entry Signals:
- OBV crosses above trend line
- Indicates increasing buying pressure
- Label: Green arrow

Exit Signals:
- OBV crosses below trend line
- Indicates decreasing buying pressure
- Label: Red arrow

Divergence Signals:
- Price and OBV moving in opposite directions
- "BULL DIV" or "BEAR DIV" label appears
- Indicates potential reversal characteristics

Signals provide money flow analysis. Interpretation varies by individual approach.
```

**Key Language Changes:**

- ✅ "OBV Concept: Cumulative volume indicator" (neutral opening)
- ❌ "Plutus Flow fixes OBV's issues"
- ✅ "Plutus Flow adds adaptive smoothing to OBV"
- ❌ "When OBV diverges, price will reverse"
- ✅ "Divergence indicates pressure shift characteristics"
