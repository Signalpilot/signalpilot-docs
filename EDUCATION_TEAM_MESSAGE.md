# Message for Education & Main Repository Teams

**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Subject:** Documentation Compliance Update & New Content Guidelines

---

## üéØ Summary

We've completed a comprehensive compliance review of all Signal Pilot documentation and identified critical issues that **must** be addressed in all future content creation:

1. **Directive Language Violations** - Documentation was giving trading advice instead of education
2. **Missing Feature Documentation** - Three major Pentarch features were undocumented
3. **Intellectual Property Exposure** - Some descriptions revealed proprietary implementation details

**All issues have been fixed in the docs repository.** Your teams need to apply the same standards going forward.

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### 1. Directive Language Removed
**Problem:** Documentation used command language that constitutes trading advice:
- ‚ùå "Enter long on IGN"
- ‚ùå "Exit when CAP fires"
- ‚ùå "Never trade without stops"
- ‚ùå "Set stop below IGN"

**Solution:** Converted all to educational language:
- ‚úÖ "IGN is commonly used as a potential long entry signal"
- ‚úÖ "CAP often triggers exit consideration"
- ‚úÖ "Trading without stops is generally considered high-risk"
- ‚úÖ "Common stop placement: below IGN candle"

**Files updated:**
- `docs/pentarch-v89.md` - All signal descriptions and examples
- `docs/ref-best-practices.md` - Entire file converted to educational language
- `docs/ref-glossary.md` - All Pentarch signal definitions

### 2. Missing Features Now Documented
**Problem:** Three critical Pentarch features had zero or minimal documentation:

‚úÖ **Pilot Line** - NOW FULLY DOCUMENTED
- What: Double-smoothed EMA (34, then 3) - the "center of gravity"
- Function: Primary trend filter that all event signals reference
- Visual: Green (uptrend), Red (downtrend), Orange (transitional)
- Importance: "The most truthful indicator" - provides bias context
- Location: `pentarch-v89.md` lines 136-192, `ref-glossary.md` lines 69-89

‚úÖ **Regime Bar Colors** - NOW FULLY DOCUMENTED
- What: 3-factor voting system (EMA structure, price vs PL, slope direction)
- Function: Colors every candle green (bull regime) or red (bear regime)
- Purpose: Shows market structural state, guides trading bias
- Location: `pentarch-v89.md` lines 194-262, `ref-glossary.md` lines 92-116

‚úÖ **NanoFlow** - NOW FULLY DOCUMENTED
- What: Micro-momentum indicator (9 vs 21 EMA crosses)
- Function: Shows momentum health between main event signals
- Frequency: 10-30/day vs 3-8/day for main events
- Critical: NOT a trade signal - it's context/confirmation only
- Location: `pentarch-v89.md` lines 264-369, `ref-glossary.md` lines 118-139

‚úÖ **Integration Section Added**
- "How All Components Work Together" section created
- 4-layer visual hierarchy explained
- Complete signal sequence example
- Location: `pentarch-v89.md` lines 371-439

### 3. IP Protection Maintained
**Problem:** Suite descriptions exposed exact algorithms and parameters

**Solution:** Sanitized all technical specifications:
- Removed Z-score methods and thresholds
- Removed exact vote counts and component numbers
- Removed formulas and calculation methods
- Kept benefits and features only

## üìã Action Items for Your Teams

### Immediate Actions

1. **Read the Compliance Guide**
   - File: `TEAM_COMPLIANCE_PROMPT.md` in the docs repository
   - This is your mandatory reference for ALL content creation
   - Print the Quick Reference Card (Section 10) and keep at your desk

2. **Review Recent Content**
   - Audit any materials created in the last 30 days
   - Use the self-audit patterns in Section 6 of the compliance guide
   - Flag any violations for immediate correction

3. **Update Templates**
   - If you use templates for courses, scripts, or examples, update them now
   - Remove all directive language
   - Ensure Pilot Line, Regime, and NanoFlow are included where relevant

### Ongoing Requirements

**For Education Team:**
- All course materials must use approved signal descriptions (Section 1 of guide)
- All examples must use educational language (Section 2 of guide)
- No algorithm details in teaching materials (Section 3 of guide)
- Ensure Pilot Line, Regime, and NanoFlow are taught comprehensively

**For Main Repository Team:**
- Code comments must not expose proprietary formulas
- README and docs must use approved language
- Release notes must be compliance-checked before publishing
- Example scripts must use educational framing

**For Marketing Team:**
- All claims must be educational, not advisory
- Signal descriptions must match Section 1 exactly
- No exposed IP in marketing materials
- Highlight ALL major features including Pilot Line, NanoFlow, regime colors

## üö® Forbidden Patterns (Never Use These)

### Directive Language (Trading Advice)
```
‚ùå NEVER SAY:
"Enter on IGN"
"Exit when CAP appears"
"Set your stop below IGN"
"DO NOT trade against HTF"
"Always use 2:1 R/R"
"Wait for candle close"
"Take profit at resistance"

‚úÖ ALWAYS SAY:
"IGN is commonly used as a potential entry signal"
"Many traders consider exiting when CAP appears"
"Common stop placement: below IGN candle"
"Trading against HTF is associated with lower probability"
"Many traders use minimum 2:1 R/R"
"Many traders wait for candle close before evaluating"
"Resistance levels are often used for profit targets"
```

### Signal Naming Violations
```
‚ùå NEVER SAY:
"TD confirms a bottom"
"IGN signals a buy"
"CAP marks the top"
"bottom/top" (use early-cycle/late-cycle instead)
"Capitulation" (use Climax for CAP signal)

‚úÖ ALWAYS SAY:
"TD indicates early-cycle reversal conditions"
"IGN indicates momentum breakout conditions"
"CAP indicates late-cycle exhaustion conditions"
"early-cycle/late-cycle"
"Climax" (for CAP signal)
```

### IP Exposure
```
‚ùå NEVER EXPOSE:
- Z-score parameters (¬±2œÉ, thresholds)
- Exact vote counts (4-vote system)
- Formula specifications (winsorized Z-scores with 3√ó cap)
- Algorithm names with versions (FlipGuard Z-Gate 2.0)
- Exact weights (RSI 40%, CCI 35%, MFI 25%)

‚úÖ ALWAYS USE:
- "Advanced statistical detection"
- "Multi-factor analysis"
- "Robust statistical methods"
- "Proprietary algorithm"
- "Optimized weighting system"
```

## üìñ Key Reference Sections in Compliance Guide

**Section 1:** Exact signal descriptions (use these verbatim)
**Section 2:** Directive vs educational language conversion table
**Section 3:** IP protection guidelines
**Section 4:** Feature documentation status (all features now covered)
**Section 5:** Practical checklist (use before publishing)
**Section 6:** Self-audit search patterns
**Section 7-9:** Real examples, team responsibilities, escalation procedures
**Section 10:** Quick reference card (print this!)

---

## ‚ùì When in Doubt

Ask yourself these 4 questions before publishing ANY content:

1. **Am I telling someone what to do?**
   ‚Üí If yes, convert to "Many traders do..." or "Common approach includes..."

2. **Am I describing a signal's meaning?**
   ‚Üí Use exact description from Section 1 of compliance guide

3. **Am I exposing how we built this?**
   ‚Üí Describe the benefit, not the method

4. **Would a regulator consider this trading advice?**
   ‚Üí Rewrite as educational information

**If you can't resolve it:** Flag for review, document your question, propose 2-3 alternatives, escalate to leadership.

## üìä What Changed in the Docs

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/pentarch-v89.md` - Major additions + compliance fixes
- `docs/ref-best-practices.md` - Complete rewrite to educational language
- `docs/ref-glossary.md` - Signal definitions fixed + new entries added
- `TEAM_COMPLIANCE_PROMPT.md` - Complete compliance guide created

**What to Review:**
1. Read the new Pilot Line, Regime, and NanoFlow sections in `pentarch-v89.md`
2. See how directive language was converted in `ref-best-practices.md`
3. Note the pattern changes in `ref-glossary.md` signal definitions

## üéØ Bottom Line

**This is not optional.** These compliance issues create:
- Regulatory risk (giving trading advice without license)
- Competitive risk (exposing intellectual property)
- Brand risk (inconsistent messaging)

**The compliance guide (`TEAM_COMPLIANCE_PROMPT.md`) is mandatory for all content creation.**

**Violations must be corrected immediately.**

---

**Questions?** Escalate to leadership before publishing.

**Document version:** 1.0 (2025-10-30)
**Next review:** Quarterly or as regulations change
