## 💭 Philosophical Perspective

### The 80/20 Rule

**80% of user benefit comes from 20% of pages:**
- Quick Start (entry point)
- Pentarch (most popular)
- Omnideck (second most popular)
- How-to-alerts (critical task)
- Workflow (strategy guide)

**We can achieve 80% of value with Option 2.**

### Diminishing Returns

**9.4 → 9.6 (+0.2):** HUGE value (accessibility transformation)
**9.6 → 9.8 (+0.2):** HIGH value (key pages enhanced)
**9.8 → 10.0 (+0.2):** Medium value (completionist polish)

**The first 0.2 points had 5x more impact than the last 0.2.**

### What Users Actually Experience

**At 9.6/10:**
- Keyboard shortcuts work everywhere ✓
- Text sizing works everywhere ✓
- Professional UX everywhere ✓
- Most pages have great content already ✓

**At 9.8/10:**
