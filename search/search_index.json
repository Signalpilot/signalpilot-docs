Spot unusual volume during key price moves. Volume Pulse (PVA Volume) Plots RVOL and Z-score spikes to highlight activity surges. Confirm when volume validates a breakout. Flow Balance (OBV Pro) Smoothed On-Balance-Volume with FlipGuard filtering. Detect silent accumulation or distribution ahead of price. <p>Rule of thumb: Momentum without volume = low conviction.

Leg Timer (TD9 + Clean Squeeze) Counts exhaustion legs (TD9) and squeeze compressions. Spot exhaustion or early squeeze breakouts. Reversal Engine (EC Pro) Event-centric detection of tops/bottoms with PilotLine + NanoFlows. Identify and alert on potential reversal events.
