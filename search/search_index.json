Data available on TradingView plan? 3. Exchange prefix included? (e.g., \"BINANCE:\" for crypto)</p> <p>Q: What's a \"good\" score? A: - 80+ = Excellent - 60-79 = Good - 40-59 = Okay - &lt;40 = Can be skipped</p> <p>Q: Should I trade every potential Elite signal? A: Not necessarily. Elite = potentially high quality, but the following should still be checked: - Market context - Trading plan - Risk management No system is 100%.</p> <p>Q: How often does it update? A: Every time a bar closes on the configured timeframes. If Symbol 1 is set to 15m, it updates every 15 minutes.</p> <p>Q: Can I get alerts? A: No (table-based indicators can't create alerts).

A: Pentarch works standalone, but combining with Janus Atlas (for levels) or Minimal Flow (for volume) increases win rate significantly.</p> <p>Q: What's the win rate? A: When you follow the signals properly and use stops, most traders see 60-70% win rate. Higher when combined with key levels.</p> <p>Q: Can I use this for day trading? A: Yes. Works on any timeframe. Lower timeframes (1m-15m) have more signals but also more noise.</p> <p>Q: What timeframe is best? A: - Beginners: Daily or 4H - Day traders: 1H or 15m - Scalpers: 5m or 15m</p> <p>Q: Does it repaint? A: No. Once a signal appears, it stays.
