## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips

**1. Wait for Bar Close**
- Signals appear during the bar but only finalize at close
- Set alerts to "Once Per Bar Close" to avoid repaints

**2. Combine with Levels**
- IGN at a key support level = Higher probability
- Use Janus Atlas to see the levels

**3. Use Stops Always**
- Example stop for longs: Below the TD/IGN candle low
- Never trade without a stop loss

**4. Start with Higher Timeframes**
- Daily chart = cleaner signals, less noise
- Work your way down to lower timeframes as you gain experience

**5. Practice on One Market First**
- Master Bitcoin or one stock before expanding
- Each market has different personality
