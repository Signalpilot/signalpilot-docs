## Step 2: Learn the 5 Signals (2 minutes)

Pentarch displays **5 simple signals** that indicate potential reversal conditions. Each signal represents a different phase in the potential trend cycle.

### The Early-Cycle Signals

**🔵 TD (Touchdown)** = Early Warning
- Indicates early-cycle reversal conditions
- Often interpreted as preparation phase
- Potential setups can be watched for by many traders

**🟢 IGN (Ignition)** = Momentum Breakout
- Indicates momentum breakout conditions
- Commonly interpreted as potential long entry signal
- Often used as bullish reversal indication

### The Late-Cycle Signals

**🟡 WRN (Warning)** = Weakening Momentum
- Indicates weakening momentum
- Often triggers risk management review
- Potential exits can be prepared for by many traders

**🔴 CAP (Climax)** = Late-Cycle Exhaustion
- Indicates late-cycle exhaustion conditions
- Commonly interpreted as potential exit signal for longs
- Often used as reversal preparation

**⚫ BDN (Breakdown)** = Bearish Breakdown
- Indicates bearish breakdown conditions
- Often triggers long position exits
- Commonly interpreted as potential short entry signal

An alert for **IGN** (potential long entry signal) can be set up:

1. **Chart can be right-clicked** → "Add Alert"
2. **Condition:** "Pentarch v1.0" can be selected

**Complete!** Notification will now be received every time a potential reversal up is indicated.

### Commonly Monitored Alerts:

## Step 4: Example Trade Illustration (1 minute)

Example showing common Pentarch signal interpretation:

### Example: Bitcoin Long Trade Scenario

**The Setup:**
```
Price: $35,000, falling for 2 weeks
```

**The Signals:**
1. **TD appears at $32,500** 🔵
   - Signal interpretation: "Early-cycle conditions developing"
   - Common response: Observation phase begins, no entry yet

2. **IGN fires at $33,800** 🟢
   - Signal interpretation: "Potential reversal up indicated"
   - Common response: Long entry at $33,900
   - Typical stop placement: Below recent low at $32,000

**The Trade Progression:**
3. **WRN appears at $41,500** 🟡
   - Signal interpretation: "Late-cycle warning"
   - Common response: Exit preparation and monitoring

4. **CAP fires at $42,800** 🔴
   - Signal interpretation: "Potential exit signal"
   - Common response: Long exit at $42,500

**Result:** $8,600 gain per coin (25% gain)

## 📋 Quick Reference Cheat Sheet

| Signal | Color | Meaning | Common Interpretation |
|--------|-------|---------|----------------------|
| TD 🔵 | Blue | Early-cycle warning | Observation phase - preparation only |
| IGN 🟢 | Green | Momentum breakout | Potential long entry signal |
| WRN 🟡 | Yellow | Weakening momentum | Exit preparation monitoring |
| CAP 🔴 | Red | Late-cycle exhaustion | Potential long exit signal |
| BDN ⚫ | Black | Bearish breakdown | Long exit / potential short signal |

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Entering on TD (Blue Signal)

**❌ Common Error:** "TD appeared, buying now!"
**✅ Better Approach:** "TD appeared, watching for IGN signal"

**Why:** TD indicates early-cycle conditions, not entry. IGN typically provides momentum breakout confirmation.

---

### Mistake #2: Not Using "Once Per Bar Close" for Alerts
<span style="color: #ff6b35; font-weight: 600;">⚠️ Critical Setup Issue</span>

**❌ Common Error:** Alert fires mid-bar, entry occurs, signal disappears
**✅ Better Approach:** Alert set to "Once Per Bar Close", only closed-bar signals trigger notifications

**How this can be fixed:**
- Incorrect alerts can be deleted
- New ones with "Once Per Bar Close" can be created
- [Alert Setup Guide](how-to-alerts.md) can be reviewed

---

### Mistake #3: Trading Without Stop Losses
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600;">🚨 Risk Management Essential</span>

**❌ Common Error:** "Will watch and exit if it goes against me"
**✅ Better Approach:** Stop loss can be determined before entry

**Common stop placement patterns:**
- **Longs:** Below IGN candle low or below TD low
- **Shorts:** Above BDN candle high or above CAP high

**Note:** Trading without predetermined stop levels is generally considered high-risk.

---

### Mistake #4: Ignoring Key Levels

**❌ Lower Quality:** All IGN signals can be evaluated regardless of level context
**✅ Higher Quality:** IGN signals at major support levels can be focused on

**Why:**
- IGN at support often shows higher probability
- IGN without level confluence typically shows lower probability
- Key levels can be identified by Janus Atlas

**Example:**
- ❌ IGN appears at $50,000 (no level) → Lower probability
- ✅ IGN appears at major support $48,500 → Higher confluence

---

### Mistake #5: Using Too Low Timeframe Initially

**❌ Wrong:** 5m or 15m charts can be started on as a beginner
**✅ Right:** Daily or 4H charts can be started with

**Why:**
- Lower timeframes = more noise
- More signals = harder to learn which are good
- Higher timeframes = clearer, higher quality signals

**Beginner progression:**
1. Start: Daily chart (cleanest)
2. Then: 4H chart (still clean)
3. Then: 1H chart (moderate)
4. Finally: 15m-30m (only when experienced)

---

### Mistake #6: Revenge Trading After a Loss

**❌ Common Pattern:** Signal failed, next signal can be immediately taken to "make it back"
**✅ Better Approach:** Break can be taken after losses, what occurred can be reviewed

**Why:**
- Emotional trading is associated with poor decisions
- Not all signals result in profitable trades
- Clear mindset is important for analysis

**Common practice:** Many traders pause after 2 losing trades to reassess.

---

### Mistake #7: Risking Too Much Per Trade

**❌ Higher Risk:** 10-20% of account can be risked on one trade
**✅ Standard Practice:** Risk of 1-2% per trade

**Example calculation:**
- $10,000 account
- Risk 2% = $200 maximum risk per trade
- Entry: $50, Stop: $48, Risk per share: $2
- Position: $200 / $2 = 100 shares maximum

**Why:** Position sizing within 1-2% is a common risk management practice.

---

### Mistake #8: Expecting 100% Win Rate

**❌ Wrong:** "This signal should work every time!"
**✅ Right:** "Even with 50-60% win rate, profitability exists with good R/R"

**Reality:**
- No indicator is perfect
- 50-60% win rate is excellent
- Profitable trading = win rate × average R/R
- 50% win rate + 3:1 R/R = very profitable

**Mindset:** Process can be focused on, not individual trade outcomes.

---

### Mistake #9: Not Paper Trading First
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600;">💡 Important for Beginners</span>

**❌ Higher Risk:** Guide can be read, live trading can be immediately started with real money
**✅ Lower Risk:** Paper trading for 2-4 weeks until consistent results

**Common paper trading approach:**
- [ ] 20+ paper trades can be executed
- [ ] Win rate and R/R can be tracked
- [ ] Rule consistency can be maintained
- [ ] Winning and losing trades can be analyzed
- [ ] Profitability over 2-4 weeks can be achieved

**Progression:** Many traders start live with minimum position sizes after paper trading success.

---

### Mistake #10: Overcomplicating with Too Many Indicators

**❌ Common Error:** All 7 <span class="signal-pilot-brand">Signal Pilot</span> indicators + 10 other indicators can be loaded on one chart
**✅ Simpler Approach:** Pentarch can be started with, Janus can be gradually added

**Why:**
- More indicators can lead to analysis paralysis
- Conflicting signals create confusion
- Simplicity often provides clarity

**Common progression for beginners:**
- Week 1-4: Pentarch only
- Week 5-8: Pentarch + Janus Atlas
- Week 9+: One more can be considered if needed (Minimal Flow or Harmonic)

## 💡 Common Best Practices

**1. Bar Close Evaluation**
- Signals appear during the bar but only finalize at close
- "Once Per Bar Close" alerts help avoid repaints

**2. Level Confluence**
- IGN at a key support level often shows higher probability
- Key price levels can be identified by Janus Atlas

**3. Stop Loss Planning**
- Common stop for longs: Below the TD/IGN candle low
- Trading without predetermined stops is generally considered high-risk

**4. Timeframe Selection**
- Daily chart typically shows cleaner signals with less noise
- Many traders start with higher timeframes, then progress to lower ones

**5. Single Market Focus**
- Learning one market (e.g., Bitcoin or one stock) before expanding is common
- Each market has different behavioral characteristics
