# Minimal Flow v1.0 Ultimate - Volume Intelligence System

## üéØ What Does It Do?
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600;">Core Functionality</span>

Minimal Flow is your **potential volume spike detector with built-in position management**. It shows you when smart money may be moving (potential volume spikes), indicates the direction is real (flow consistency), and manages your entire trade from entry to exit.

**Best for:** Volume traders, systematic traders, anyone serious about risk management

## Core Concept: Volume = Truth
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üí° Core Philosophy - Volume Shows Intent</span>

Price can lie. Volume cannot.

**The System:**
1. **Detects potential volume spikes** (Z-score method - statistically significant)
2. **Confirms direction** (volume + price must agree)
3. **Checks market regime** (trending or ranging?)
4. **Verifies higher timeframe** (HTF confirms direction?)
5. **Manages your position** (entry, partials, stops, exits)

**Result:** Potential high-probability signals with automatic risk management

## Real Example (Bitcoin)

**Setup:**
- Price: $64,000
- You're watching 15m chart
- Account: $10,000, Risk: 1%

**Signal Fires:**
- **BUY** signal at $64,200
- Quality: 87 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Elite)
- Volume spike: Z = 3.4 (very strong)
- Position size: 0.15 BTC (calculated by system)
- Stop: $63,000 (1,200 below entry)
- TP1: $67,800 (3,600 above entry, 3:1 R:R)

**The Trade:**
1. You enter long at $64,200 (0.15 BTC)
2. Stop can be set at $63,000
3. Price rallies to $67,800 ‚Üí TP1 hit
4. You take 50% off (0.075 BTC) = +$270 locked
5. Stop can be moved to breakeven ($64,200)
6. Remaining 0.075 BTC trails
7. Price continues to $70,000
8. Trailing stop hits at $69,200 (2% trail)
9. You exit remaining 0.075 BTC = +$375 more

**Total:** $270 + $375 = $645 profit (6.45% on account, 64.5:1 R:R on risk)

## Common Pitfalls
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üö® Critical Learning Points</span>

‚ùå **Disregarding calculated stops**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Stop calculations have algorithmic basis. Stop adjustment = emotion-based trading pattern

‚ùå **Omitting T1 partial exits**
‚Üí ‚úÖ 50% exit at TP1 is the standard profit-locking approach

‚ùå **Using on Forex spot markets**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Volume data requirement exists. Futures, stocks, crypto are suitable. Forex spot lacks volume data.

‚ùå **Trading all signals indiscriminately**
‚Üí ‚úÖ ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Elite and ‚≠ê‚≠ê Premium signal focus is recommended during learning phase

‚ùå **Risk % misalignment with personal comfort**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Risk % should match personal tolerance levels (0.5% to 1.5% range adjustment based on comfort)

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Common Questions</span>

**Q: Do I need to enable position management?**
**A:** No. You can use signals only and manage manually. But position management is the power feature - highly recommended.

**Q: Does this work on Forex?**
**A:** Only Forex futures (CME) or CFDs with volume. Spot Forex (OANDA, etc.) has NO volume ‚Üí won't work.

**Q: What Z-threshold should I use?**
**A:**
- Scalpers: 2.0 (more signals)
- Day traders: 2.5 (balanced)
- Swing traders: 3.0 (fewer, stronger)

**Q: How often do potential Elite signals appear?**
**A:**
- 15m chart: 1-2 per day
- 1H chart: 2-4 per week
- 4H chart: 1-2 per week

**Q: What if I miss the entry?**
**A:** Skip it. Don't chase. Wait for next signal. Chasing = worse entry = worse R:R.

**Q: Does it repaint?**
**A:** No. All signals lock at bar close. What you see is what you get.
