## üí° Pro Tips

### Start Simple
- Don't load all 7 indicators at once
- Master 1-2 first, then add gradually
- Complexity ‚â† Better results

### Focus on Confluence
- One signal = Interesting
- Two signals = Worth attention
- Three+ signals = High probability
- **Example:** Pentarch IGN + Janus Weekly Low + Minimal Flow spike = ELITE setup

### Respect the Regime
- All indicators have regime/trend components
- **Green regime = Only longs**
- **Red regime = Only shorts**
- This ONE rule increases win rate 15-20%

### Use Quality Filters
- Most indicators have quality scoring/tiers
- Potential Elite/Premium signals = Take these
- Standard/Weak = Skip unless perfect confluence
- Quality over quantity always wins

### Track Your Performance
- After 20 trades, calculate win rate by:
  - Indicator (which works best for YOU)
  - Quality tier (Elite vs Standard)
  - Market regime (bull vs bear vs neutral)
- Adjust your filters based on YOUR results

### Customize for Your Style
- Scalper: Use tighter settings, lower timeframes
- Swing trader: Use higher quality filters, higher timeframes
- Position trader: Conservative modes, Weekly/Monthly timeframes
- **No single setup works for everyone**
