## ðŸ“… Day 6: Risk Management Setup

### Goal: Prepare for safe trading

    - Risk: 1% = $100
    - Entry: Bitcoin at $40,000
    - Stop: $39,000
    - Risk per unit: $1,000
    - Position size: $100 / $1,000 = 0.1 BTC

    - My account: $______
    - My risk (1%): $______
    - Calculate position sizes for 3 different setups

- [ ] **Set risk rules**
  - Write down these rules:
    - "I will risk maximum 1-2% per trade"

    - "I will NEVER move stop closer to entry"
    - "I will take breaks after 2 losses in a day"

- [ ] **Calculate risk/reward**
  - Find a historical IGN setup
  - Entry: IGN price
  - Stop: Below support
  - Target: Next resistance
  - Calculate R/R: (Target - Entry) / (Entry - Stop)
  - Should be at least 2:1

- [ ] **Create position size calculator**
  - Use spreadsheet or notes app
