# Minimal Flow v1.0 Ultimate - Volume Intelligence System

## What Does It Do?

Minimal Flow is your **potential volume spike detector with built-in position management**. It tells you when smart money may be moving (potential volume spikes), confirms the direction is real (flow consistency), and manages your entire trade from entry to exit.

**Best for:** Volume traders, systematic traders, anyone serious about risk management

---

## Core Concept: Volume = Truth

Price can lie. Volume cannot.

**The System:**
1. **Detects potential volume spikes** (Z-score method - statistically significant)
2. **Confirms direction** (volume + price must agree)
3. **Checks market regime** (trending or ranging?)
4. **Verifies higher timeframe** (HTF confirms direction?)
5. **Manages your position** (entry, partials, stops, exits)

**Result:** Potential high-probability signals with automatic risk management

---

## The Main Signals (What You See)

### Volume Histogram (Bottom Pane)

**What you see:** Bars showing volume

**Colors:**
- **Green** = Buying pressure
- **Red** = Selling pressure
- **Bright green/red** = SPIKE detected (Z-score > threshold)

**What to watch:** Bright colored spikes = Smart money moving

---

### Buy/Sell Signals

**BUY Signal** (green label + arrow)
- Potential volume spike detected
- Buyers potentially dominating (positive flow)
- Bullish price bar
- Regime potentially confirms (or neutral)
- Optional: HTF aligned

**SELL Signal** (red label + arrow)
- Potential volume spike detected
- Sellers potentially dominating (negative flow)
- Bearish price bar
- Regime potentially confirms (or neutral)
- Optional: HTF aligned

---

2. Signal label appears (BUY or SELL)
3. Quality score shows (aim for ‚≠ê‚≠ê or ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê)
4. Entry price line draws on chart

**Then:**
- Enter on signal bar close or next bar open

### Step 3: Manage the Trade

- Label shows current P&L

**Example trade setup:**
1. Example entry at entry price
2. Example stop placement at the dotted line
3. Example profit target: 50% at TP1 (dashed line)
4. Example trailing stop: remaining 50% with 2% trail
5. Example exit: opposite signal or stop hit

**The system calculates, you execute.**

## Real Example (Bitcoin)

**Setup:**
- Price: $64,000
- You're watching 15m chart
- Account: $10,000, Risk: 1%

**Signal Fires:**
- **BUY** signal at $64,200
- Quality: 87 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê (Elite)
- Volume spike: Z = 3.4 (very strong)
- Position size: 0.15 BTC (calculated by system)
- Stop: $63,000 (1,200 below entry)
- TP1: $67,800 (3,600 above entry, 3:1 R:R)

**The Trade:**
1. You enter long at $64,200 (0.15 BTC)
2. Set stop at $63,000
3. Price rallies to $67,800 ‚Üí TP1 hit
4. You take 50% off (0.075 BTC) = +$270 locked
5. Move stop to breakeven ($64,200)
6. Remaining 0.075 BTC trails
7. Price continues to $70,000
8. Trailing stop hits at $69,200 (2% trail)
9. You exit remaining 0.075 BTC = +$375 more

**Total:** $270 + $375 = $645 profit (6.45% on account, 64.5:1 R:R on risk)

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

‚ùå **Not honoring stops**
‚Üí ‚úÖ System calculates stops for a reason. Moving stops = emotional trading = losses

‚ùå **Skipping T1 partials**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Always take 50% at TP1. Locks in profit, reduces stress

‚ùå **Using on Forex spot**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Need volume data! Use futures, stocks, crypto. Forex spot has no volume.

‚ùå **Trading every signal**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Focus on ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Elite and ‚≠ê‚≠ê Premium when learning

‚ùå **Wrong risk % for your comfort**
‚Üí ‚úÖ If 1% feels too much, use 0.5%. If too conservative, use 1.5%. Match to your emotion.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to enable position management?**
**A:** No. You can use signals only and manage manually. But position management is the power feature - highly recommended.

**Q: Does this work on Forex?**
**A:** Only Forex futures (CME) or CFDs with volume. Spot Forex (OANDA, etc.) has NO volume ‚Üí won't work.

**Q: What Z-threshold should I use?**
**A:**
- Scalpers: 2.0 (more signals)
- Day traders: 2.5 (balanced)
- Swing traders: 3.0 (fewer, stronger)

**Q: How often do potential Elite signals appear?**
**A:**
- 15m chart: 1-2 per day
- 1H chart: 2-4 per week
- 4H chart: 1-2 per week

**Q: What if I miss the entry?**
**A:** Skip it. Don't chase. Wait for next signal. Chasing = worse entry = worse R:R.

**Q: Does it repaint?**
**A:** No. All signals lock at bar close. What you see is what you get.
