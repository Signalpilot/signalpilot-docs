## What is Minimal Flow?

"Minimal" doesn't mean simple - it means **essential**. This is the minimal set of volume analysis tools you need, refined to perfection. "Flow" represents money flow, order flow, volume flow - the hidden force behind price movement.

### What Makes v4.0 "Ultimate"?

This isn't just a volume spike detector. It's a **complete trading system:**

✅ **Elite Spike Detection** - Z-score based volume anomaly identification
✅ **Flow Consistency** - Directional agreement analysis (volume + price must align)
✅ **4-Vote Regime Detection** - Optimized multi-factor trend identification
✅ **HTF Confirmation** - Dual timeframe alignment filters
✅ **Volatility Adaptation** - Automatic threshold adjustment for market conditions
✅ **Position Management** - Entry, partial exits, trailing stops, breakeven
✅ **Risk Calculator** - Automatic position sizing based on account and ATR
✅ **Quality Scoring** - 0-100 rating with star system (⭐⭐⭐)
✅ **Strategy Modes** - Trend Following / Mean Reversion / Hybrid
✅ **Complete Alerts** - Entry, exit, partial profit, regime warnings

## Core Concept: Volume Tells the Truth

Price can be manipulated. Volume cannot.

**The Principle:**
- Large volume spikes = Smart money moving
- Directional consistency = Real intent (not noise)
- Multi-timeframe agreement = High confidence
- Regime awareness = Context (trend vs range)

Minimal Flow combines all four into **actionable signals with automatic risk management**.

---

## System Components

### 1. Volume Spike Detection (Z-Score Method)

**What it measures:**
How unusual is the current volume compared to recent history?

**Z-Score Formula:**
```
Z = (Current Volume - Average Volume) / Standard Deviation
```

**Interpretation:**
- Z > 2.0 = Moderate spike (noteworthy)
- Z > 2.5 = Strong spike (significant)
- Z > 3.0 = Elite spike (rare, powerful)

**Why Z-Score?**
- Adaptive (automatically adjusts to instrument volatility)
- Objective (not arbitrary thresholds)
- Proven (statistical significance testing)

**Settings:**
- `Z-Threshold` (default: 2.5) - Minimum spike strength
- Higher = Fewer but stronger signals
- Lower = More signals but more noise

---

### 2. Flow Consistency Analysis

**What it measures:**
Does the price movement agree with volume direction?

**The Components:**

**Volume Delta:**
- Buying volume vs selling volume
- Positive delta = Buyers dominant
- Negative delta = Sellers dominant

**Price Movement:**
- Bullish bar = Close > Open
- Bearish bar = Close < Open

**Consistency Check:**
```
Bullish Signal requires:
  - Volume spike (Z > threshold)
  - Positive volume delta (buyers winning)
  - Bullish price bar (close > open)
  = All three must align!

Bearish Signal requires:
  - Volume spike (Z > threshold)
  - Negative volume delta (sellers winning)
  - Bearish price bar (close < open)
  = All three must align!
```

**Why Consistency Matters:**
Volume spike alone means nothing. Volume spike + directional agreement = institutional positioning.

**Settings:**
- `Flow Ratio Threshold` (default: 0.65) - How much agreement required
- 1.0 = Perfect agreement (very strict)
- 0.5 = Moderate agreement (balanced)
- Lower = More lenient

---

### 3. Regime Detection (4-Vote System)

**What it measures:**
Is the market trending (bullish/bearish) or ranging (neutral)?

**The 4 Votes:**

**Vote 1: Delta Z-Score Trend** (Weight: 35%)
- Is volume delta consistently positive (bullish) or negative (bearish)?
- Most important vote

**Vote 2: Volume Trend** (Weight: 25%)
- Is total volume increasing (participation growing)?
- Confirms sustained interest

**Vote 3: Price Momentum** (Weight: 25%)
- Is price trending clearly in one direction?
- Confirms price confirmation

**Vote 4: Divergence Check** (Weight: 15%)
- Are there hidden warnings (price vs volume divergence)?
- Reduces false signals

**Regime Calculation:**
```
Total Score = (Vote1 × 0.35) + (Vote2 × 0.25) + (Vote3 × 0.25) + (Vote4 × 0.15)

If Score > +threshold: BULLISH Regime
If Score < -threshold: BEARISH Regime
If between: NEUTRAL Regime
```

**Settings:**
- `Regime Mode` - Conservative / Balanced / Aggressive
  - **Conservative:** Requires strong regime (less signals, higher quality)
  - **Balanced:** Default (good balance)
  - **Aggressive:** Looser regime requirements (more signals)

**Regime Lookback:** 100 bars (optimized, don't change unless you know why)

---

### 4. Volatility Adaptation

**What it does:**
Automatically adjusts signal thresholds based on current market volatility.

**The States:**

**HIGH Volatility** (ATR significantly elevated)
- Tighter Z-threshold (only strongest spikes)
- Stricter flow requirements
- Wider stops
- Prevents overtrading in chaos

**NORMAL Volatility**
- Standard thresholds
- Balanced settings

**LOW Volatility** (ATR compressed)
- Slightly looser Z-threshold (catch more signals)
- Tighter stops
- Prepare for breakout

**How it helps:**
You don't manually adjust settings for market conditions - Minimal Flow does it automatically.

---

### 5. Multi-Timeframe Confirmation

**What it does:**
Checks if higher timeframes agree with the signal direction.

**The Setup:**

**Primary HTF** (e.g., if on 15m, check 1H)
- Is HTF regime bullish/bearish/neutral?
- Does HTF agree with signal direction?

**Secondary HTF** (e.g., if on 15m, check 4H)
- Additional confirmation layer
- Optional but recommended

**HTF Alignment Logic:**
```
Bullish Signal on 15m:
  - 1H regime = Bullish → Full points
  - 1H regime = Neutral → Partial points
  - 1H regime = Bearish → Signal rejected or downgraded

With both HTF checks:
  Both agree → Elite quality
  One agrees → Premium quality
  None agree → Standard or skip
```

**Settings:**
- `Primary HTF` (default: auto, typically 4x chart TF)
- `Secondary HTF` (default: auto, typically 16x chart TF)
- `Require HTF Alignment` (default: false, but downgrades score if misaligned)

---

### 6. Strategy Modes

**What it does:**
Switches the signal logic based on your trading style.

**The Three Modes:**

**TREND FOLLOWING** (default)
- Only trades WITH the regime
- Bullish regime → Long signals only
- Bearish regime → Short signals only
- Neutral → No signals
- **Best for:** Momentum traders, breakout traders

**MEAN REVERSION**
- Trades AGAINST temporary extremes
- Bullish regime → Short overbought spikes, buy dips
- Bearish regime → Long oversold spikes, sell rips
- **Best for:** Range traders, contrarian traders

**HYBRID**
- Combines both approaches
- Strong regime → Trend following
- Weak regime → Mean reversion
- Adaptive based on market state
- **Best for:** Flexible traders, multi-strategy

**Choose based on your personality and market conditions.**

---

### 7. Position Management System

This is where Minimal Flow becomes a **complete trading system**, not just signals.

**Entry:**
- Signals fire with automatic entry logic
- Position size calculated from risk parameters
- Entry price: Close of signal bar or next bar open

**Stop Loss:**
- ATR-based automatic calculation
- `ATR Stop Multiplier` (default: 2.0)
- Example: If ATR = $5, stop = $10 below entry (2.0 × $5)
- Adjust multiplier based on volatility tolerance

**Take Profit 1 (T1) - Partial Exit:**
- First target hit → Take 50% off (default)
- `ATR Target Multiplier` (default: 3.0)
- Example: If ATR = $5, T1 = $15 above entry (3.0 × $5)
- Locks in profit, reduces risk

**Trailing Stop:**
- After T1 hit, remaining 50% trails
- `Trailing Stop %` (default: 2.0%)
- Captures extended moves
- Protects profits

**Breakeven Move:**
- Optional: Move stop to entry price after T1
- Eliminates risk on remaining position
- `Move to Breakeven` (default: true)

**Exit Signals:**
- Opposite signal fires → Full exit
- Stop hit → Full exit
- Trailing stop hit → Exit remaining 50%

**Visual Display:**
- Green line = Long entry price
- Red line = Short entry price
- Dotted line = Stop loss
- Dashed line = T1 target
- Labels show P&L on active trades

---

### 8. Risk Calculator

**Automatic Position Sizing:**

**Inputs:**
- `Account Size` (e.g., $10,000)
- `Risk Per Trade %` (default: 1.0%)
- ATR Stop Multiplier (already set)

**Calculation:**
```
Risk Amount = Account Size × (Risk % / 100)
Example: $10,000 × 0.01 = $100 risk per trade

Stop Distance = ATR × ATR Stop Multiplier
Example: ATR $5 × 2.0 = $10 stop

Position Size = Risk Amount / Stop Distance
Example: $100 / $10 = 10 units

If trading stock at $50:
10 units = 10 shares
```

**Displayed on Chart:**
- Each signal shows recommended position size
- Adjust account size and risk % to fit your capital
- System calculates everything else

---

### 9. Quality Scoring (0-100)

Every signal gets rated 0-100 based on:

**Factors:**
1. **Z-Score Strength** (0-25 pts) - Higher Z = more points
2. **Flow Consistency** (0-20 pts) - Better agreement = more points
3. **Regime Strength** (0-20 pts) - Stronger regime = more points
4. **HTF Alignment** (0-20 pts) - Multi-TF agreement = more points
5. **Volatility Context** (0-10 pts) - Appropriate conditions = more points
6. **Signal Freshness** (0-5 pts) - Recent regime flip = bonus points

**Star Ratings:**
- ⭐⭐⭐ **Elite** (80-100) - Take every time
- ⭐⭐ **Premium** (60-79) - High quality
- ⭐ **Standard** (40-59) - Acceptable
- **Weak** (<40) - Skip or very selective

**Displayed:**
- Score shows in label
- Stars show visually
- Filter by minimum score in settings

## SP Protocol Compliance

### 🔒 Repaint Audit (v4.0)

**Security Calls:**
All HTF requests use deterministic settings:
```
Line ~178: htf1_regime = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, htf1_tf, calc_regime(),
                         lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)
Line ~179: htf2_regime = request.security(syminfo.tickerid, htf2_tf, calc_regime(),
                         lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)
```

**Signal Generation:**
All signals use confirmed bar data:
```
Line ~456: bullSignal = zScore > zThreshold and flowRatio > flowThresh and
                        regime > regimeThresh and barstate.isconfirmed
Line ~457: bearSignal = zScore > zThreshold and flowRatio > flowThresh and
                        regime < -regimeThresh and barstate.isconfirmed
```

**Alert Conditions:**
All 5 alerts gated by confirmation:
```
Line ~789: alertcondition(bullSignal and barstate.isconfirmed, "Bull Signal")
Line ~792: alertcondition(bearSignal and barstate.isconfirmed, "Bear Signal")
Line ~795: alertcondition(t1Hit and barstate.isconfirmed, "T1 Hit")
Line ~798: alertcondition(exitWarning and barstate.isconfirmed, "Exit Warning")
Line ~801: alertcondition(regimeWeaken and barstate.isconfirmed, "Regime Weakening")
```

**Position Management:**
All entry/exit logic uses confirmed closes:
```
Line ~634: if bullSignal and barstate.isconfirmed
Line ~635:     entryPrice := close // Confirmed close, not real-time
```

**Verdict:** ✅ **ZERO repaint vectors detected**

---

### 📋 Behavioral Contract

**On Unconfirmed Bars:**
- Volume calculations update in real-time
- Z-score updates as volume develops
- Flow ratio updates with bar progress
- Regime calculations update
- HTF data may update
- **NO signals fire, NO labels appear, NO alerts trigger**

**On Bar Close:**
- All calculations lock in
- Signals evaluate and fire if conditions met
- Labels appear (permanent)
- Alerts trigger
- Position management logic executes
- All values become historical and unchangeable

**HTF Alignment:**
- HTF data uses `lookahead_off` → may lag 1 bar
- Intentional for determinism
- Tradeoff: Slight delay vs perfect future knowledge
- Benefit: Signals never disappear on refresh

---

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Volume Data Required**
   - Indicator requires volume data
   - Forex spot (OANDA, etc.) has no volume → Won't work
   - Futures, stocks, crypto work perfectly
   - Solution: Use instruments with volume data

2. **Position Management = Visual Only**
   - Lines and labels show entry/stop/target
   - Does NOT execute trades automatically
   - You must manually enter trades at your broker
   - System is decision support, not algo execution

3. **Account Size Must Be Accurate**
   - Position sizing depends on your inputted account size
   - If wrong, position sizes will be wrong
   - Update settings when account grows/shrinks

4. **ATR-Based Stops Can Be Wide**
   - In high volatility, ATR expands → wide stops
   - This is intentional (prevents premature stops)
   - If too wide for your risk tolerance, reduce ATR multiplier
   - Tradeoff: Tighter stops = more stop-outs

5. **Regime Detection Lag**
   - 100-bar lookback means regime adapts slowly
   - This is intentional (prevents whipsaw)
   - Fast-changing markets may show lag
   - Solution: Use Aggressive regime mode for faster adaptation

6. **HTF Data Intrabar Repaint**
   - HTF regime can update intrabar (before bar confirms)
   - This is acceptable because signals wait for bar close
   - Visual quality score may flicker during bar formation
   - Once bar closes, everything locks in

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to enable position management?**
A: No. You can use signals only and manage trades manually. Position management is optional but recommended.

**Q: Does this work on Forex?**
A: Only on Forex futures (CME) or CFDs with volume data. Spot Forex (OANDA, etc.) has no volume → won't work.

**Q: What's the best Z-threshold?**
A: Default 2.5 is balanced. Scalpers can use 2.0 (more signals), swing traders can use 3.0 (fewer, stronger signals).

**Q: Should I use Trend Following or Mean Reversion mode?**
A: **Trending markets** = Trend Following. **Ranging markets** = Mean Reversion. **Unsure** = Hybrid (adapts automatically).

**Q: How often do Elite signals appear?**
A: Depends on timeframe and market:
- 15m chart: 1-2 Elite per day
- 1H chart: 2-4 Elite per week
- 4H/Daily: 1-2 Elite per week

**Q: Can I change the regime voting weights?**
A: You CAN (they're in settings), but you SHOULDN'T. These were optimized across thousands of backtests. Changing them will likely make performance worse.

**Q: What if a signal fires but I miss the entry?**
A: Skip it. Don't chase. Wait for the next signal. Chasing = worse entry = worse R:R.

**Q: How do I know if position management is working?**
A: Check the chart - you should see:
- Entry price line (green/red)
- Stop loss line (dotted)
- T1 target line (dashed)
- Position size label
- P&L updating in real-time

**Q: Can I use this for crypto, stocks, AND futures simultaneously?**
A: Yes! The indicator adapts to any instrument with volume data.

## Best Practices

1. **Honor Your Stops - No Exceptions**
   - System calculates stops for a reason
   - Moving stops = emotional trading = losses
   - If stopped out, move on to next signal

2. **Take T1 Partials Every Time**
   - Locks in profit
   - Reduces emotional pressure
   - Lets remaining position run stress-free

3. **Match Risk % to Your Comfort**
   - 1% = Conservative
   - 2% = Moderate
   - 3%+ = Aggressive (experienced only)
   - Never risk more than you can handle emotionally

4. **Filter by Quality in Learning Phase**
   - First 20 trades: Only ⭐⭐⭐ Elite
   - Next 20 trades: Add ⭐⭐ Premium
   - Once profitable: Consider ⭐ Standard

5. **Use Appropriate Timeframe**
   - Scalper: 5m-15m
   - Day trader: 15m-1H
   - Swing trader: 4H-Daily
   - Wrong timeframe = mismatched expectations

6. **Track Your Stats**
   - Win rate by quality tier
   - Win rate by regime (bull/bear/neutral)
   - Average R:R

7. **Don't Trade Against Strong Regime**
   - Regime green + bear signal = Low probability
   - Regime red + bull signal = Low probability
   - Quality score accounts for this, but manually verify

8. **Respect Volatility States**
   - HIGH volatility: Reduce position size
   - NORMAL: Standard sizing
   - LOW: Standard sizing, prepare for breakout
