# Minimal Flow v1.0 Ultimate - Volume Intelligence System

## What Does It Do?

Minimal Flow is your **potential volume spike detector with built-in position management**. It shows you when smart money may be moving (potential volume spikes), indicates the direction is real (flow consistency), and manages your entire trade from entry to exit.

**Best for:** Volume traders, systematic traders, anyone serious about risk management

## Core Concept: Volume = Truth
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üí° Core Philosophy - Volume Shows Intent</span>

Price can lie. Volume cannot.

**The System:**
1. **Detects potential volume spikes** (Z-score method - statistically significant)
2. **Confirms direction** (volume + price must agree)
3. **Checks market regime** (trending or ranging?)
4. **Verifies higher timeframe** (HTF confirms direction?)
5. **Manages your position** (entry, partials, stops, exits)

**Result:** Potential high-probability signals with automatic risk management

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üö® Critical Errors to Avoid</span>

‚ùå **Not honoring stops**
‚Üí ‚úÖ System calculates stops for a reason. Moving stops = emotional trading = losses

‚ùå **Skipping T1 partials**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Always take 50% at TP1. Locks in profit, reduces stress

‚ùå **Using on Forex spot**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Need volume data! Use futures, stocks, crypto. Forex spot has no volume.

‚ùå **Trading every signal**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Focus on ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Elite and ‚≠ê‚≠ê Premium when learning

‚ùå **Wrong risk % for your comfort**
‚Üí ‚úÖ If 1% feels too much, use 0.5%. If too conservative, use 1.5%. Match to your emotion.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need to enable position management?**
**A:** No. You can use signals only and manage manually. But position management is the power feature - highly recommended.

**Q: Does this work on Forex?**
**A:** Only Forex futures (CME) or CFDs with volume. Spot Forex (OANDA, etc.) has NO volume ‚Üí won't work.

**Q: What Z-threshold should I use?**
**A:**
- Scalpers: 2.0 (more signals)
- Day traders: 2.5 (balanced)
- Swing traders: 3.0 (fewer, stronger)

**Q: How often do potential Elite signals appear?**
**A:**
- 15m chart: 1-2 per day
- 1H chart: 2-4 per week
- 4H chart: 1-2 per week

**Q: What if I miss the entry?**
**A:** Skip it. Don't chase. Wait for next signal. Chasing = worse entry = worse R:R.

**Q: Does it repaint?**
