## üéØ Core Principles

### 1. Quality Over Quantity

**Selective signal evaluation**

‚ùå Lower quality approach: Trading all IGN signals regardless of context
‚úÖ Higher quality approach: Focusing on IGN at major support with volume confirmation

**Why:**
- Not all signals are equal
- Confluence improves win rate dramatically
- Fewer, better trades = better results

**Minimum confluence checklist:**
- [ ] Signal (IGN/CAP/BDN)
- [ ] Key level (Janus support/resistance)
- [ ] Trend alignment (with HTF)

---

### 2. Higher Timeframes = Higher Quality

**Start analysis on higher timeframes**

**Recommended workflow:**
1. **Daily** can be checked for overall bias and major levels
2. **4H** can be dropped to for intermediate structure
3. **1H** or **4H** can be executed on for swing trades
4. Or **15m-1H** for day trades

**Why:**
- Daily levels are strongest
- HTF trends are more reliable
- Lower timeframes are noisier
- HTF context prevents counter-trend traps

**Common guideline:** Trading against Daily trend is generally avoided unless CHOCH is confirmed, as it's associated with lower probability setups.

---

### 3. Stop Loss Usage

**Standard risk management practice in trading**

**Common stop loss placement patterns:**

**For long positions (IGN-based entries):**
- Typical placement: Below the IGN candle low
- Alternative placement: Below nearest Janus support
- Often using whichever level is closer/tighter

**For short positions (BDN-based entries):**
- Typical placement: Above the BDN candle high
- Alternative placement: Above nearest Janus resistance
- Often using whichever level is closer/tighter

**Common stop management guidelines:**
- Stops are typically set before position entry
- Moving stops closer to entry increases original risk assessment
- Trailing stops in favorable direction is common practice
- Positions risking more than 2% of account are generally filtered out

---

### 4. Trade With the Trend

**"Trend is your friend until the bend"**

**How to identify trend:**
1. The Daily chart can be opened
2. Last 20-50 candles can be looked at
3. Higher highs + higher lows = Uptrend
4. Lower highs + lower lows = Downtrend
5. Mixed = Range (avoid or range-trade)

**Trading rules:**
- Uptrend: Only take IGN signals
- Downtrend: Only take BDN/CAP signals
- Range: Trade bounces off support/resistance

**When to counter-trend:**
- Only after CHOCH confirmation
- Only with strong Pentarch signal at major level
- Only if experienced trader

## üìä Signal-Specific Best Practices

### Pentarch Reversal Signals

#### TD (Touchdown)

**Common usage patterns:**
- TD is typically used as an advance warning signal
- Many traders watch for follow-up IGN before taking action
- Often interpreted as "watch" rather than "entry"

**Note:**
TD and IGN serve different functions‚ÄîTD indicates early-cycle conditions while IGN indicates momentum breakout conditions.

---

#### IGN (Ignition)

**Common usage patterns:**
- IGN is commonly used as a potential long entry signal
- Many traders wait for candle close before evaluating
- Often combined with nearby Janus support levels
- Common stop placement: below IGN candle or support level

**Higher-probability IGN scenarios:**
- At major Janus support levels
- Following TD warning signals
- With regime filter alignment (LOK)
- In higher timeframe uptrends
- With volume confirmation

**Lower-probability IGN scenarios:**
- Far from support levels
- Against higher timeframe downtrends
- During low volatility periods
- Near major resistance levels

---

#### WRN (Warning)

**Common usage patterns:**
- Often used to adjust risk management
- Many traders watch for CAP confirmation before exiting
- Commonly seen as preparation signal rather than immediate action
- Can appear multiple times during strong trends

**Note:**
WRN indicates late-cycle conditions developing, but strong trends can sustain multiple WRN signals before actual exhaustion.

---

#### CAP (Climax)

**Common usage patterns:**
- Often used as exit consideration for long positions
- Many traders adjust stops or take profits
- Can be used to watch for BDN confirmation for shorts

**Higher-conviction CAP scenarios:**
- CAP at major resistance levels
- Following extended price moves
- Against higher timeframe downtrends
- Multiple WRN/CAP signals in sequence

**Lower-conviction CAP scenarios:**
- CAP mid-trend with room to run
- Higher timeframe remains bullish
- Significant support levels below current price

---

#### BDN (Breakdown)

**Common usage patterns:**
- Commonly used as potential short entry signal
- Often triggers long position exits
- Common stop placement: above BDN candle or resistance

**Higher-probability BDN scenarios:**
- At major Janus resistance levels
- Following CAP/WRN warning signals
- With regime filter alignment (SOK)
- In higher timeframe downtrends
- With volume confirmation

**Lower-probability BDN scenarios:**
- Far from resistance levels
- Against higher timeframe uptrends
- During low volatility periods
- Near major support levels

---

### Janus Atlas Level Trading

#### Support Levels

**Common usage patterns:**
- Support levels are often used as potential entry zones
- Many traders wait for price to reach the level before evaluating
- Commonly combined with Pentarch IGN signals at support
- Multiple touches typically indicate stronger support

**Support break scenarios:**
When price closes below support:
- Former support often becomes resistance
- Traders commonly watch for BDN confirmation signals
- Catching exact bottoms can be challenging

---

#### Resistance Levels

**Common usage patterns:**
- Resistance levels are often used as potential exit zones
- Many traders watch for Pentarch CAP/BDN signals at resistance
- Shorts are commonly considered at resistance in downtrends
- Multiple rejections typically indicate stronger resistance

**Resistance break scenarios:**
When price closes above resistance:
- Former resistance often becomes support
- Traders commonly watch for IGN confirmation signals
- Pullbacks to broken resistance can provide entry opportunities

---

#### FVG (Fair Value Gaps)

**Common usage patterns:**
- FVGs are often treated as potential support/resistance zones
- Bullish FVGs commonly viewed as support areas
- Bearish FVGs commonly viewed as resistance areas
- Many traders combine FVGs with Pentarch signals

**Typical FVG approach:**
1. FVG can be identified on chart
2. Price return to FVG zone can be watched for
3. Pentarch signal confirmation can be looked for (e.g., IGN in bullish FVG)
4. Common stop placement: beyond the FVG
5. Common targets: Opposite FVG or next key level

---

#### Order Blocks (OB)

**Common usage patterns:**
- Order blocks are commonly used as potential entry zones
- Many traders wait for price to revisit the OB before evaluating
- Often combined with Pentarch signals at the OB
- Common stop placement: beyond the OB boundary
- OBs typically considered invalid after price closes through them

**Typical bullish OB scenario:**
- Price retraces to bullish OB zone
- IGN signal appears in OB area
- Potential long consideration
- Common stop: below OB
- Common target: Next resistance level

## üéöÔ∏è Risk Management Essentials

### Position Sizing

**The 1-2% Rule**

**1% Rule (Conservative):**
- Risk maximum 1% of account per trade
- Example: $10,000 account = $100 risk max

**2% Rule (Aggressive):**
- Risk maximum 2% of account per trade
- Example: $10,000 account = $200 risk max

**Calculation:**
```
Position Size = (Account Size √ó Risk %) √∑ (Entry Price - Stop Price)

Example:
- Account: $10,000
- Risk: 1% = $100
- Entry: $50
- Stop: $48
- Risk per share: $2

Position Size = $100 √∑ $2 = 50 shares
```

**Common practice:** Most risk management frameworks recommend not exceeding 2% risk per trade.

---

### Risk/Reward Ratios

**Minimum 2:1 R/R**

**Calculation:**
```
R/R = (Target - Entry) / (Entry - Stop)

Example:
- Entry: $50
- Stop: $48 (risk $2)
- Target: $56 (reward $6)
- R/R = $6 / $2 = 3:1 ‚úÖ Good

Example Lower R/R:
- Entry: $50
- Stop: $48 (risk $2)
- Target: $52 (reward $2)
- R/R = $2 / $2 = 1:1 ‚ùå Generally considered unfavorable
```

**Common guidelines:**
- Many traders use minimum 2:1 R/R (risk $1 to potentially make $2)
- 3:1 or better is often preferred
- R/R less than 2:1 is typically filtered out
- Janus levels are commonly used for target placement

---

### Scaling In/Out

**Scaling OUT (Taking Profits):**

**Method 1: Thirds**
- Common approach: Exit 1/3 at 2:1 R/R
- Exit 1/3 at 4:1 R/R
- Let 1/3 run to trail stop or opposite signal

**Method 2: Half & Half**
- Common approach: Exit 50% at 2:1 R/R
- Let 50% run to trail stop

**Method 3: Full Exit**
- Some traders exit entire position at opposite signal
- Simpler approach with less management

**Scaling IN (Pyramiding):**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Advanced technique - not recommended for beginners**

**Common guidelines for pyramiding:**
- Typically only added to winning positions
- Each new position often smaller than previous
- Generally avoid averaging down (adding to losers)
- Many traders move stops to breakeven after adding

---

## üìà Workflow Optimization

3. **Opportunity prioritization**
   - Many traders focus on 3-5 best setups
   - Confluence factors (signal + level + trend) commonly used
   - Alert setting for potential entries

4. **Economic calendar review**
   - Noting major news events
   - Many traders avoid trading 30min before/after major news
   - Increased caution during high-impact data releases

---

### During Trading Hours

**Common active monitoring patterns:**

   - Typically set to "Once Per Bar Close"
   - Checking chart when alert fires
   - Verifying setup remains valid

2. **Pre-entry confirmation**
   - Checking if signal is at key level
   - Evaluating HTF support for direction
   - Confirming R/R is at least 2:1
   - Position size calculation

3. **Execution practices**

---

## üß† Psychological Best Practices

### Common Discipline Guidelines

1. **Stop loss usage** - Trading without stops is generally considered high-risk
2. **Stop management** - Moving stops toward entry increases risk; trailing in profit is more common
3. **Position sizing after losses** - Increasing size after losses (revenge trading) often leads to larger losses
4. **Break patterns** - Many traders take breaks after 2 losing trades to maintain clarity
5. **Emotional trading** - Trading while angry, stressed, or tired is associated with poor decision-making

---

### Common Psychological Traps

#### FOMO (Fear of Missing Out)

**Pattern:** Chasing signals after they've moved

**Common approaches:**
- Waiting for next setup rather than chasing missed entries
- Recognizing that opportunities are continuous
- Looking for pullbacks or new setups instead of chasing

---

#### Overtrading

**Pattern:** Taking too many trades, accepting low-quality setups

**Common approaches:**
- Some traders use daily/weekly trade limits (e.g., 5 trades per week)
- Requiring minimum confluence factors (typically 2+)
- Focusing on quality over quantity

---

#### Revenge Trading

**Pattern:** Attempting to recover losses immediately after losing trades

**Common approaches:**
- Taking breaks after consecutive losses (often 2 in a day)
- Reviewing what went wrong before continuing
- Returning to trading with clearer mindset

---

#### Fear of Losing

**Pattern:** Exiting winners too early while letting losers run

**Common approaches:**
- Using predetermined targets (often 2:1 R/R minimum)
- Employing trailing stops on winning positions
- Cutting losing positions at predetermined stop levels

---

## üì± Technical Setup Optimization

### Alert Management

**Common practices:**

1. **Alert frequency** - "Once Per Bar Close" is standard to avoid spam
2. **Naming conventions** - Clear names like "BTC 4H IGN Long" for easy identification
3. **Organization** - Grouping alerts by timeframe for easier management
4. **Alert limits** - Many traders keep 5-10 active alerts to avoid overwhelm
5. **Testing** - Verifying alerts on lower timeframes before live use

---

### Chart Organization

**Common chart setup patterns:**

1. **Indicator limits**
   - Many traders use maximum 3 indicators per chart
   - More indicators can slow performance and create visual clutter
   - Omnideck already combines multiple indicators

2. **Layout management**
   - Saving successful setups as templates
   - Enabling quick switching between symbols

3. **Level visualization**
   - Major levels: Often marked with bright colors
   - Minor levels: Typically dimmer colors or hidden
   - Reduces visual noise

4. **Multi-timeframe monitoring**
   - Primary chart: Entry timeframe
   - Secondary view: Higher timeframe for bias context

---

### Watchlist Management

**Common watchlist practices:**

1. **Size management**
   - Many traders maintain 10-20 symbols
   - Larger watchlists can lead to analysis paralysis
   - Focusing on most active instruments

2. **Categorization**
   - Crypto majors
   - Forex pairs
   - Stock indices
   - Individual stocks

3. **Dynamic rotation**
   - Removing low-volatility/ranging symbols
   - Adding trending instruments
   - Adapting to market conditions

4. **Augury Grid usage**
   - Scanning entire watchlist efficiently
   - Focusing detailed analysis on active signals

---

## üö´ Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Patterns associated with poor trading outcomes:**

1. ‚ùå Trading without stops - significantly increases risk
2. ‚ùå Moving stops closer to entry - reduces original risk assessment
3. ‚ùå Averaging down on losing positions - compounds losses
4. ‚ùå Overtrading - quality typically more important than quantity
5. ‚ùå Trading against HTF trend (beginners) - lower probability setups
6. ‚ùå Using all 7 indicators simultaneously - creates visual clutter and confusion
7. ‚ùå Taking every signal without confluence - reduces win rate
8. ‚ùå Chasing trades after initial move - often results in poor entries
9. ‚ùå Emotion-based trading - associated with poor decision-making
10. ‚ùå Risking more than 2% per trade - can lead to rapid account depletion
