# Signal Pilot Documentation - Compliance Language Guide

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL UPDATE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**Deadline: 7 days from receipt**

---

## üö® Critical Notice from Leadership

**Subject:** Critical Update - Signal Language Must Include "Potential" Qualifiers

**Background:** We've received feedback from payment processors (LemonSqueezy) that our signal descriptions are being misinterpreted as definitive predictions rather than educational indicators. To ensure compliance and accurately represent our product, we need to update ALL educational and documentation materials.

**This language update is critical for our payment processor relationships and legal compliance.**

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Core Principle

**Signal Pilot provides analysis tools for educational purposes, not trading advice or guaranteed outcomes.**

All materials must:
- Emphasize **possibilities** not **certainties**
- Use **conditional language** ("potential", "may", "could", "might")
- Focus on **tool functionality** not trading recommendations
- Include **disclaimers** prominently

---

## üîç Signal Descriptions - Before & After

### ‚ùå INCORRECT (Remove These Immediately)

**These phrases are being flagged by payment processors:**

- "TOUCHDOWN is a bottom signal"

- "top approaching"
- "exit now"
- "reversal confirmed"
- "This is a bottom"
- "TD 9 marks the top"
- "Bottom confirmed"
- "The signal confirms..."
- "This means the bottom is in"

### ‚úÖ CORRECT (Use These)

## üìñ Examples of Compliant Language

### Educational Content Example
```
"When TD (Touchdown) fires, it detects a potential bottoming formation.
This means selling pressure may be showing exhaustion after a downtrend.
Traders can use this signal to consider whether a reversal might be developing."
```

### Signal Explanation Example
```
"The Pentarch system maps potential market cycles through 5 phases.
When you see TD ‚Üí IGN, you're observing a potential bottom development.
When you see WRN ‚Üí CAP ‚Üí BDN, you're watching a potential top formation."
```

### Warning Language to Include
```
"Remember: All signals are educational tools showing possibilities, not certainties.
These indicators help you analyze market conditions, but they don't guarantee outcomes.
Always conduct your own research and manage your risk appropriately."
```

---

## üéØ Key Principles (Critical for Compliance)

### 1. **Always Prefix Predictions with "Potential"**
‚úÖ "**Potential** reversal signal"
‚ùå "Reversal signal"

**Any reference to market direction, tops, bottoms, reversals, breakouts MUST include "potential"**

### 2. **Emphasize Educational Nature**
‚úÖ "These are indicators to aid analysis, not trading directives"
‚úÖ "Users should use these as part of their research, not as standalone decisions"

### 3. **Avoid Definitive Language**
‚ùå "The signal confirms..."
‚úÖ "The signal suggests a potential..."

‚ùå "This means the bottom is in"
‚úÖ "This indicates a potential bottoming formation"

### 4. **Focus on Possibilities, Not Certainties**
‚úÖ "This tool helps you identify potential market patterns"
‚ùå "This tool tells you when to buy and sell"

‚úÖ "For educational and analysis purposes"
‚ùå "For guaranteed trading profits"

### 2. **Conditional Language**
Always use: **potential, possible, may, might, could, suggests, indicates**

‚úÖ "The indicator **suggests** a **potential** reversal"
‚ùå "The indicator confirms a reversal"

### 3. **Tool Description Focus**
Describe **what the tool does**, not **what traders should do**

‚úÖ "Detects TD Sequential exhaustion signals"
‚ùå "Tells you when to enter trades"

‚úÖ "Displays VWAP anchors from multiple timeframes"
‚ùå "Shows you where to buy support"

### 4. **Historical Context**
Reference past performance, not future guarantees

‚úÖ "Historically, this pattern has preceded..."
‚ùå "This pattern will cause..."

‚úÖ "In backtesting, this setup showed..."
‚ùå "This setup guarantees..."
