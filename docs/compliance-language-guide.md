# Signal Pilot Documentation - Compliance Language Guide

**Purpose:** Ensure all Signal Pilot materials use appropriate educational language and avoid implications of financial advice.

**Audience:** Documentation team, education team, content creators, video producers

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Core Principle

**Signal Pilot provides analysis tools for educational purposes, not trading advice or guaranteed outcomes.**

All materials must:
- Emphasize **possibilities** not **certainties**
- Use **conditional language** ("potential", "may", "could", "might")
- Focus on **tool functionality** not trading recommendations
- Include **disclaimers** prominently

## üéØ Key Principles

### 1. **Educational Framing**
‚úÖ "This tool helps you identify potential market patterns"
‚ùå "This tool tells you when to buy and sell"

‚úÖ "For educational and analysis purposes"
‚ùå "For guaranteed trading profits"

### 2. **Conditional Language**
Always use: **potential, possible, may, might, could, suggests, indicates**

‚úÖ "The indicator **suggests** a **potential** reversal"
‚ùå "The indicator confirms a reversal"

### 3. **Tool Description Focus**
Describe **what the tool does**, not **what traders should do**

‚úÖ "Detects TD Sequential exhaustion signals"
‚ùå "Tells you when to enter trades"

‚úÖ "Displays VWAP anchors from multiple timeframes"
‚ùå "Shows you where to buy support"

### 4. **Historical Context**
Reference past performance, not future guarantees

‚úÖ "Historically, this pattern has preceded..."
‚ùå "This pattern will cause..."

‚úÖ "In backtesting, this setup showed..."
‚ùå "This setup guarantees..."
