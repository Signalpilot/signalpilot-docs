# SP — SD Zones (SDZones Pro) — by Signal Pilot

Clean, easy supply/demand zones for TradingView. Green = areas where buyers showed up before (demand). Red = areas where sellers showed up before (supply). It stays tidy, scores stronger areas, and can alert you when price touches or breaks a zone.

## Quick Start (60 seconds)

1. **Add to chart** in TradingView (Indicators → Invite‑only scripts → **SD Zones (SDZones Pro)**).
2. **Keep the defaults.** It’s already clean.
3. If it still looks busy:
   - Turn **Quiet Mode** ON (default).
   - Set **Max visible per side** to **3–4**.
   - Keep **Compact view** ON (shows only the last ~40 bars).

You’re done. Treat zones as **areas** (not exact lines).

## How to read the chart

- **Green box = Demand**  
  Where price bounced up before (possible support).

- **Red box = Supply**  
  Where price turned down before (possible resistance).

- **Flip shading**  
  If price breaks through a box and later trades back into it, that box may “switch sides.”  
  (Example: broken red → can act like green.)

- **Small badge with a number (0–10)**  
  Quick strength score. Higher ≈ more “reasons” that area matters:
  - Near average price (**VWAP**)
  - Near **yesterday’s high/low**
  - Near common **moving averages**
  - Near a **round number** (e.g., 100, 1000)

**Tip:** Use zones to plan **where** you’ll look for trades. Use your own entry trigger to decide **when**.

---

## Alerts (optional but handy)

- **First Touch** — Notifies the first time price re‑enters a box.  
- **Broken** — Notifies when price breaks a box.

> In TradingView, set alert timing to **“Once per bar close”** for reliability.

---

## Settings you’ll actually use

- **Quiet Mode** (ON): Keeps only the most useful boxes near current price.  
- **Max visible per side**: Lower number = cleaner chart (try **3–4**).  
- **Compact view**: Shows boxes only across recent bars (default ~40). Increase if you want more history.  
- **Outline only**: Borders without fill for a super‑clean look.  
- **Flip zones**: Leave ON. It flags role changes (very useful).  

**Break rule (simple choice):**
- **Close (stricter)** — A box is “broken” only if the candle **closes** through it.  
- **Wick (looser)** — Even a quick spike counts as broken.

## Simple workflows

**Day trading**
1. Quiet Mode ON • Max per side = 3–4 • Compact width ~40.  
2. Turn on **First Touch** and **Broken** alerts for key boxes.  
3. Use your own entry trigger (e.g., a candle pattern or momentum tick) at/near the zone.

**Swing trading**
1. Increase Compact width (e.g., **80–120**) to see more history.  
2. Use **Close** as the break rule (stricter).  
3. Prefer zones with **higher badge scores**.

## Why boxes appear or disappear

- **Appear** when price clearly turned at a spot in the past.  
- **Fade/Hide** when broken, overlapped by a stronger area, or too old.  
- **Good thing:** The chart stays readable. Only the relevant stuff remains.

---

## Cheat sheet (what labels mean)

- **Badge like “C 6.4 VW EMA RN x2”**
  - **C 6.4** = score (0–10). Higher = stronger.  
  - **VW** = near VWAP  
  - **EMA** = near common moving averages  
  - **RN** = near a round number  
  - **x2** = touched twice  
  - **FLIP** = role changed after a break/retest

---

## Good habits

- Treat zones as **areas**, not hard lines.  
- Give entries some breathing room; don’t put stops exactly on the edge.  
- Combine with your plan (trend, risk, trigger).  
- Alerts help you **wait** for price to come to you.

## FAQ

**Does this predict the future?**  
No. It highlights areas where price reacted before. You still need your plan and risk rules.

**Why did a box vanish?**  
It was broken, overlapped by a stronger one, or got too old. This is on purpose to keep charts clean.

**Do I need to change many settings?**  
No. Defaults are solid. If it feels busy, reduce **Max visible per side**.

**What markets/timeframes work?**  
Any. Crypto, stocks, FX, futures; 1‑minute to weekly.
