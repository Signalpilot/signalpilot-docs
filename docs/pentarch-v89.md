## The 5 Signals (Easy to Understand)

### 🔵 TD - "Get Ready, Bottom Coming"

**What you see:** Blue "TD" label below the candle

**What it means:** Price has pulled back hard and is getting oversold. A reversal UP might be starting soon.

**What to do:**
- Start watching for a long entry
- Wait for IGN to confirm (next signal)
- Don't jump in yet - this is just the warning

**Example:** Stock drops from $100 to $85, TD appears → bottom might be forming

### 🟢 IGN - "GO! Reversal Confirmed"

**What you see:** Green "IGN" label below the candle

**What it means:** The reversal is CONFIRMED. Bulls are taking over.

**What to do:**
- This is your entry signal for longs
- Enter on this bar or next bar
- Set your stop below the recent low

**Example:** After TD at $85, IGN fires at $87 → Enter long, reversal confirmed

### 🟡 WRN - "Warning, Top Ahead"

**What you see:** Yellow "WRN" label above the candle

**What it means:** Price is getting extended. A top might be forming soon.

**What to do:**
- Start tightening your stops if you're in a long
- Get ready to exit
- Don't buy here - it's too late

**Example:** Stock rallied to $115, WRN appears → start preparing to exit

---

### 🔴 CAP - "TOP! Exit Now"

**What you see:** Red "CAP" label above the candle

**What it means:** Final exhaustion. This is often the top before a drop.

**What to do:**
- Exit your longs immediately
- This is the "sell" signal
- Advanced traders can short here

**Example:** After WRN at $115, CAP fires at $120 → Exit, top is in

### ⚫ OUT - "Reversal Down Confirmed"

**What you see:** Dark "OUT" label above the candle

**What it means:** The breakdown is CONFIRMED. Bears are taking over.

**What to do:**

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

❌ **Buying on TD**
→ ✅ TD is just a warning. Wait for IGN to confirm.

❌ **Ignoring CAP signals**
→ ✅ When CAP fires, exit. Don't hope for more.

❌ **Trading every signal**
→ ✅ Best signals are at key support/resistance levels (use with Janus Atlas)

❌ **No stop loss**
→ ✅ Always use stops. Not every signal works perfectly.

❌ **Using on 1-minute chart without experience**
→ ✅ Start with 1H or Daily charts first. More reliable signals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How often do signals appear?**
**A:** Depends on timeframe:
- Daily chart: 2-4 complete cycles per month
- 1H chart: 1-2 cycles per week
- 15m chart: Multiple per day

**Q: Do I need other indicators?**
**A:** Pentarch works standalone, but combining with Janus Atlas (for levels) or Minimal Flow (for volume) increases win rate significantly.

**Q: What's the win rate?**
**A:** When you follow the signals properly and use stops, most traders see 60-70% win rate. Higher when combined with key levels.

**Q: Can I use this for day trading?**
**A:** Yes! Works on any timeframe. Just know that lower timeframes (1m-15m) have more signals but also more noise.

**Q: What timeframe is best?**
**A:**
- Beginners: Daily or 4H
- Day traders: 1H or 15m
- Scalpers: 5m or 15m

**Q: Does it repaint?**

**Q: What if I miss the IGN entry?**
**A:** Don't chase. Wait for the next TD→IGN setup. There's always another trade.

## Best Practices

1. **Start on higher timeframes** (Daily or 4H) to learn the signals

2. **Use with Janus Atlas** to see if signals happen at key levels (better win rate)

3. **Set alerts** so you don't miss signals

4. **Take partials** - Exit 50% at WRN, let 50% run to CAP

5. **Keep a journal** - Track which signals work best for you

6. **Be patient** - Don't force trades. Best setups have TD→IGN or WRN→CAP→OUT sequences
