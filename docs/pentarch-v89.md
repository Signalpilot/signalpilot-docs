# Pentarch v1.0 - Potential Reversal Signals Made Simple

## What Does It Do?

Pentarch shows you **5 simple signals** that indicate when price may potentially reverse. Think of it like traffic lights for potential reversals - it shows you when to get ready, when to go, and when to exit.

**The 5-Phase System:** TD → IGN → WRN → CAP → BDN

**Best for:** Anyone who wants to identify potential reversals without guessing

---

## The 5 Signals (Easy to Understand)

### 🔵 TD - "Get Ready, Potential Bottom Coming"

**What you see:** Blue "TD" label below the candle

**What it means:** Price has pulled back hard and is getting oversold. A potential reversal UP might be starting soon.

**What to do:**
- Start watching for a long entry
- Wait for IGN to confirm (next signal)
- Don't jump in yet - this is just the warning

**Example:** Stock drops from $100 to $85, TD appears → potential bottom might be forming

---

### 🟢 IGN - "GO! Potential Reversal Signal"

**What you see:** Green "IGN" label below the candle

**What it means:** Potential reversal indication. Bulls may be taking over.

**Example usage:**
- This is a potential entry signal for longs
- Example entry timing: this bar or next bar
- Example stop placement: below the recent low

**Example:** After TD at $85, IGN fires at $87 → Enter long, potential reversal indicated

---

### 🟡 WRN - "Warning, Potential Top Ahead"

**What you see:** Yellow "WRN" label above the candle

**What it means:** Price is getting extended. A potential top might be forming soon.

**Example response:**
- Example risk management: tighten stops if long
- Prepare for potential exit
- Educational note: Late entry reduces favorable risk/reward

**Example:** Stock rallied to $115, WRN appears → start preparing to exit

---

### 🔴 CAP - "Potential TOP! Potential Exit Signal"

**What you see:** Red "CAP" label above the candle

**What it means:** Final exhaustion. This often indicates a potential top before a drop.

**What to do:**
- Consider exiting your longs
- This is a potential "sell" signal
- Advanced traders can consider shorts here

**Example:** After WRN at $115, CAP fires at $120 → Exit, potential top is indicated

---

### ⚫ BDN - "Potential Breakdown Signal"

**What you see:** Dark "BDN" label above the candle

**What it means:** Potential breakdown indication. Bears may be taking over. Signals a potential bearish structure break.

**Example response:**
- Consider exiting any remaining longs
- For short sellers: This is a potential entry signal
- Potential breakdown and reversal down is indicated

**Example:** After CAP at $120, BDN fires at $113 → Potential breakdown and downtrend indicated

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

❌ **Buying on TD**
→ ✅ TD is just a warning. Wait for IGN to confirm.

❌ **Ignoring CAP signals**
→ ✅ When CAP fires, exit. Don't hope for more.

❌ **Trading every signal**
→ ✅ Best signals are at key support/resistance levels (use with Janus Atlas)

❌ **No stop loss**
→ ✅ Always use stops. Not every signal works perfectly.

❌ **Using on 1-minute chart without experience**
→ ✅ Start with 1H or Daily charts first. More reliable signals.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**A:** Depends on timeframe:
- Daily chart: 2-4 complete cycles per month
- 1H chart: 1-2 cycles per week
- 15m chart: Multiple per day

**Q: Do I need other indicators?**
**A:** Pentarch works standalone, but combining with Janus Atlas (for levels) or Minimal Flow (for volume) increases win rate significantly.

**Q: What's the win rate?**
**A:** When you follow the signals properly and use stops, most traders see 60-70% win rate. Higher when combined with key levels.

**Q: Can I use this for day trading?**
**A:** Yes! Works on any timeframe. Just know that lower timeframes (1m-15m) have more signals but also more noise.

**Q: What timeframe is best?**
**A:**
- Beginners: Daily or 4H
- Day traders: 1H or 15m
- Scalpers: 5m or 15m

**Q: Does it repaint?**

## Best Practices

1. **Start on higher timeframes** (Daily or 4H) to learn the signals

2. **Use with Janus Atlas** to see if signals happen at key levels (better win rate)

3. **Set alerts** so you don't miss signals

4. **Take partials** - Exit 50% at WRN, let 50% run to CAP

5. **Keep a journal** - Track which signals work best for you

6. **Be patient** - Don't force trades. Best setups have TD→IGN or WRN→CAP→BDN sequences
