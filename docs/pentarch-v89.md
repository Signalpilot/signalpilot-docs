# Pentarch v8.9 - Reversal Event Detection System

## Overview

**Pentarch** is an advanced reversal detection system that identifies 5 critical event types across market cycles. Think of it as your "structural event radar" - pinpointing exact moments when price is setting up for major reversals or breaking down from exhaustion.

**Type:** Chart Overlay
**Best For:** Swing traders, reversal traders, multi-timeframe analysis
**Complexity:** Intermediate to Advanced

---

## What Makes Pentarch Different?

Unlike simple indicator crosses or oscillator signals, Pentarch uses a sophisticated **event detection framework** that combines:

- **Regime awareness** (bull vs bear market structure)
- **Timeframe-adaptive thresholds** (automatically adjusts from 1-minute to Monthly charts)
- **Volume confirmation** (new in v8.9 - CAP events now detect volume burst exhaustion)
- **Multi-factor validation** (every signal requires multiple confirmations)

Each of the 5 event types serves a specific purpose in the reversal cycle.

---

## The 5 Event Types

### 🔵 TD (Touchdown) - Oversold Base Formation

**What it detects:** Deep pullbacks where price is setting a base for potential reversal

**How it works:**
- Price must be in a downtrend (regime stability check)
- Multiple oversold conditions must align (RSI, momentum, position relative to moving averages)
- Timeframe-adaptive thresholds ensure it works on any chart (1m through Monthly)

**When to use it:**
- Looking for early warning of potential bottoms
- Planning counter-trend entries
- Identifying accumulation zones

**Visual:** Blue label "TD" below price bars

---

### 🟢 IGN (Ignition) - Bull Reversal Confirmation

**What it detects:** The confirmed flip from bearish to bullish - your "GO" signal

**How it works:** (v8.9 stability enhancement)
- Price must have shown TD (base formation) recently
- Regime must flip bullish (3-factor voting: EMA34>EMA55, close>PilotLine, slope confirmation)
- **NEW:** Regime stability check prevents false ignitions during choppy conditions
- Momentum must confirm the shift

**When to use it:**
- Confirming reversal after TD setup
- Entry trigger for swing longs
- Adding to positions after base formation

**Visual:** Green label "IGN" below price bars

**Critical detail:** IGN requires recent TD context. You won't get random IGN signals - they're anchored to structural setups.

---

### 🟡 WRN (Warning) - Early Top Detection

**What it detects:** First signs of exhaustion at potential tops

**How it works:**
- Price must be extended (overbought conditions)
- Multiple warning signals align (RSI extremes, momentum divergence, position relative to bands)
- Not a sell signal yet - it's a WARNING to prepare

**When to use it:**
- Tightening stop losses on existing longs
- Preparing for potential exit
- Reducing position size
- Watching for CAP confirmation

**Visual:** Yellow label "WRN" above price bars

---

### 🔴 CAP (Capitulation) - Final Thrust Exhaustion

**What it detects:** The explosive "blow-off top" or final exhaustion thrust

**How it works:** (v8.9 volume burst path added)
- Extreme overbought conditions
- **NEW:** Volume burst detection - identifies unsustainable volume spikes
- Parabolic price movement
- Multiple exhaustion signals align

**When to use it:**
- Exit signal for swing longs
- Potential short entry for aggressive traders
- Final warning before likely reversal

**Visual:** Red label "CAP" above price bars

**Critical detail:** CAP often comes with a volume spike that's unsustainable. The v8.9 volume burst path identifies these specifically.

---

### ⚫ OUT (Breakdown) - Bear Reversal Confirmation

**What it detects:** The confirmed flip from bullish to bearish - your "EXIT" signal

**How it works:**
- Price must have shown WRN/CAP (top formation) recently
- Regime must flip bearish (3-factor voting flips negative)
- Momentum confirms the breakdown
- Structure breaks down

**When to use it:**
- Confirming reversal after WRN/CAP setup
- Exit trigger for remaining longs
- Entry trigger for swing shorts (if trading both sides)

**Visual:** Dark label "OUT" above price bars

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Add to Chart
Load Pentarch v8.9 on any timeframe (works from 1-minute to Monthly)

### 2. Understand the Flow
The events follow a natural market cycle:

**Bull Cycle:** TD → IGN → (trend) → WRN → CAP → OUT → repeat

**Real example:**
1. Price pulls back deeply → **TD** appears
2. Price reverses and regime flips → **IGN** confirms
3. Price rallies for days/weeks
4. Price gets extended → **WRN** appears (first warning)
5. Price makes final parabolic move → **CAP** with volume spike
6. Price breaks down → **OUT** confirms the reversal

### 3. Combine with Confirmation
Pentarch works best when combined with:
- **Volume analysis** (Minimal Flow, Plutus Flow)
- **Structure levels** (Janus Atlas for key levels)
- **Momentum confirmation** (Harmonic Oscillator)

---

## Additional Features

### Pilot Line (EMA34 Smoothed)
A smoothed version of the 34-period EMA that acts as dynamic support/resistance:
- **Above Pilot Line** = bullish bias
- **Below Pilot Line** = bearish bias
- **Ribbon visualization** shows trend strength

**Settings:**
- Toggle on/off
- Customizable color
- Optional ribbon fill

### NanoFlow Crosses
Micro-trend momentum detector:
- **Green cross** = micro uptrend starting
- **Red cross** = micro downtrend starting

These help you see momentum shifts between major events.

### Momentum Thrust Arrows
Breakout detection on the main trend:
- **↑ Green arrow** = bullish thrust breakout
- **↓ Red arrow** = bearish thrust breakdown

### Regime Box
Background coloring that shows market regime:
- **Green tint** = bullish regime
- **Red tint** = bearish regime
- **Gray** = neutral/transitioning

## Strategy Examples

### Conservative Reversal Trading

**Setup:**
1. Wait for **TD** event (oversold base forming)
2. Confirm with volume analysis (use Minimal Flow or Plutus Flow)
3. Enter on **IGN** confirmation
4. Set stop below recent low
5. Exit on **WRN** (first warning) or **CAP** (exhaustion)

**Risk/Reward:** High probability, moderate reward

---

### Aggressive Top-Picking

**Setup:**
1. Watch for price extension (overbought)
2. **WRN** appears (first warning)
3. **CAP** confirms with volume burst (v8.9 detection)
4. Enter short on **OUT** confirmation
5. Target previous support zones (use Janus Atlas)

**Risk/Reward:** Lower probability, high reward (requires tight risk management)

---

### Multi-Timeframe Confirmation

**Setup:**
1. Daily chart: **IGN** event fires (bull reversal confirmed)
2. 4H chart: Wait for pullback to support
3. 1H chart: Look for **TD → IGN** sequence on the pullback
4. Enter on 1H **IGN** with daily trend
5. Exit on daily **WRN** or **CAP**

**Risk/Reward:** Very high probability, large reward potential

## Technical Specifications

### Performance Stats
- **Plot Count:** 9
- **Security Calls:** 4 (HTF EMAs for regime detection)
  - `htfE34D` (Daily EMA34)
  - `htfE55D` (Daily EMA55)
  - `htfE34W` (Weekly EMA34)
  - `htfE55W` (Weekly EMA55)
- **Timeframe Support:** 1-minute through Monthly
- **All signals:** Gated by `barstate.isconfirmed` (ZERO intrabar repainting)

### Regime Detection (3-Factor Voting)
1. **EMA Position:** Is EMA34 > EMA55?
2. **Price Position:** Is close > Pilot Line?
3. **Slope Confirmation:** Is momentum trending correctly?

**Bull regime:** 2 of 3 factors must be true
**Bear regime:** 2 of 3 factors must be false

### Timeframe-Adaptive Thresholds
Each event type has different thresholds based on the current chart timeframe:
- **Intraday (≤60min):** Tighter thresholds, faster signals
- **Swing (Daily):** Balanced thresholds, quality over quantity
- **Position (Weekly/Monthly):** Wider thresholds, major events only

This ensures the indicator doesn't fire too many signals on HTF or too few on LTF.

## SP Protocol Compliance

### 🔒 Repaint Audit (v8.9)

**Security Calls:**
All HTF requests use `lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off`:
- Line ~247: `request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", ta.ema(close, 34), lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)`
- Line ~248: `request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", ta.ema(close, 55), lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)`
- Line ~249: `request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "W", ta.ema(close, 34), lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)`
- Line ~250: `request.security(syminfo.tickerid, "W", ta.ema(close, 55), lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)`

**Alert Conditions:**
All 13 alert conditions gated by `and barstate.isconfirmed`:
- Line ~892: `alertcondition(tdEvent and barstate.isconfirmed, ...)`
- Line ~895: `alertcondition(ignEvent and barstate.isconfirmed, ...)`
- Line ~898: `alertcondition(wrnEvent and barstate.isconfirmed, ...)`
- Line ~901: `alertcondition(capEvent and barstate.isconfirmed, ...)`
- Line ~904: `alertcondition(outEvent and barstate.isconfirmed, ...)`
- (All other alerts similarly gated)

**Label/Shape Creation:**
All visual markers anchored to confirmed bars only:
- Line ~712: `if tdEvent and barstate.isconfirmed`
- Line ~725: `if ignEvent and barstate.isconfirmed`
- Line ~738: `if wrnEvent and barstate.isconfirmed`
- (All events use same pattern)

**Verdict:** ✅ **ZERO repaint vectors detected**

---

### 📋 Behavioral Contract

**On Unconfirmed Bars:**
- Real-time calculations update (visible if you watch live)
- Event logic evaluates continuously
- No labels, shapes, or alerts fire
- Background colors and lines update visually

**On Bar Close:**
- All event conditions lock in
- Labels/shapes are drawn (permanent)
- Alerts fire if conditions met
- All values become historical and unchangeable

**HTF Alignment:**
- Daily/Weekly EMAs use `lookahead_off` → may lag by 1 bar for determinism
- This is INTENTIONAL to prevent future data leaking into current bar
- The tradeoff: Signals may be 1 bar delayed vs "perfect" future-peeking
- Benefit: What you see is what you get - no disappearing signals on refresh

---

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **HTF Data Lag (Acceptable Tradeoff)**
   - Daily/Weekly EMAs arrive with 1-bar confirmation delay
   - This prevents repainting but may delay regime flip detection by 1 bar
   - Alternative considered: Use lookahead_on → Rejected (creates repaint risk)
   - Solution implemented: Close-confirmed HTF data only

2. **Multi-Event Bars**
   - In extreme volatility, multiple events CAN fire on the same bar
   - Example: A bar could have both WRN and CAP if move is violent enough
   - This is by design - the bar met multiple criteria
   - User should prioritize the stronger signal (CAP > WRN in this case)

3. **Event Spacing**
   - No minimum cooldown between events (intentional)
   - Reason: Markets can reverse quickly, especially on lower timeframes
   - Rapid TD→IGN or WRN→CAP→OUT sequences are valid
   - User should filter by timeframe if too noisy

4. **Volume Data Dependency**
   - CAP volume burst path requires volume data
   - On instruments without volume (Forex spot), this path is disabled
   - Regular CAP detection still works (based on price exhaustion only)

### 🧪 Reproducibility Test

**Test Setup:**
- Symbol: BTC/USD (Coinbase)
- Timeframe: Daily
- Date Range: January 1, 2024 - March 31, 2024
- Version: v8.9

**Expected Events:**

| Date | Event Type | Price Level | Details |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Jan 23, 2024 | IGN | ~$40,120 | Ignition after early Jan pullback |
| Feb 14, 2024 | WRN | ~$51,850 | First warning at Feb high |
| Feb 28, 2024 | TD | ~$57,240 | Touchdown on late Feb dip |
| Mar 5, 2024 | IGN | ~$65,670 | Ignition starting March rally |
| Mar 14, 2024 | CAP | ~$73,150 | Capitulation at March ATH with volume burst |

**Verification Method:**
1. Load indicator on specified chart
2. Zoom to date range
3. Check DataWindow for exact values at bar_index of each date
4. Values must remain constant on page refresh
5. Different users must see identical signals

**AI Reproducibility:**
If a different AI implementation reads this spec and generates the event logic from scratch, it must produce identical event signals on the test data. This proves the specification is complete and deterministic.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use Pentarch on Forex?**
A: Yes! All features work except CAP volume burst detection (Forex spot has no volume). Regular CAP detection based on price exhaustion still functions.

**Q: What timeframe works best?**
A: Pentarch adapts to any timeframe, but sweet spots are:
- **Scalping:** 5-15min (fast signals)
- **Day trading:** 1H-4H (balanced)
- **Swing trading:** Daily (highest quality)
- **Position trading:** Weekly (major events only)

**Q: How often do events fire?**
A: Depends on timeframe and market volatility:
- Daily BTC: ~2-4 event cycles per month
- 4H ES: ~1-2 cycles per week
- 15min scalping: Multiple per day (noisier)

**Q: Do I need other indicators?**
A: Pentarch is powerful standalone, but combining with:
- Volume confirmation (Minimal Flow, Plutus Flow) → Higher win rate
- Key levels (Janus Atlas) → Better entries/exits
- Momentum filter (Harmonic Oscillator) → Trade quality filter

**Q: Can events fire in any order?**
A: No - events follow market structure logic:
- IGN requires recent TD context
- OUT requires recent WRN/CAP context
- You won't get random IGN or OUT without setup

**Q: What's the difference between WRN and CAP?**
A: **WRN** = first warning (price extended), **CAP** = final exhaustion (parabolic move + volume). Think of WRN as "get ready" and CAP as "time to exit."

## Best Practices

1. **Don't chase late entries** - If IGN fired 20 bars ago and price is extended, wait for next TD→IGN cycle

2. **Use stops** - Pentarch identifies reversals, but not all setups work. Always use stop losses below TD/above CAP

3. **Combine timeframes** - Higher timeframe event + lower timeframe entry = optimal setup

4. **Watch for volume** - v8.9 CAP events with volume bursts are highest probability reversal points

5. **Filter by regime** - Trading IGN in a strong bull regime (HTF) = higher probability than IGN in bear regime

6. **Respect OUT signals** - When OUT fires after a WRN→CAP sequence, the reversal is confirmed. Don't fight it.
