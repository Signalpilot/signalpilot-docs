## 📍 The Levels (What You Get)
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Level Types</span>
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">⭐ Core Feature - 39 Level Types Available</span>

### 📅 Timeframe Levels
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📊 Foundation - Daily/Weekly/Monthly Ranges</span>

**What you see:** Lines labeled dH, dL, WH, WL, MtH, etc.

**What they are:**
- **Daily High/Low** (dH/dL) - Today's range
- **Weekly High/Low** (WH/WL) - This week's range
- **Monthly High/Low** (MtH/MtL) - This month's range
- **Opens & Midpoints** - Reference points for each timeframe

**Why they matter:** Price reacts at these levels. They're like magnets - price either bounces off them or breaks through decisively.

**Example:** Bitcoin drops to Weekly Low at $65,000 → Often bounces back up (support)

---

### 🕐 Session Levels
<span style="color: #a855f7; font-weight: 600;">⏰ Scalper Essential - Asian/Euro/NA Ranges</span>

**What you see:** Lines labeled AH, AL (Asian), EH, EL (European), NAH, NAL (North American)

**What they are:** High and low of each trading session

**Why they matter:**
- Asian lows often get "swept" during London open (stop hunt)
- North American highs are key resistance for the day
- Session breaks = liquidity grabs

**Example:** Price spikes above Asian High at $66,500, immediately drops → Classic fake-out

---

### 📊 VWAP Lines
<span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600;">💰 Institutional Favorite - True Average Price</span>

**What you see:** Lines labeled VWAP-D, VWAP-W (and previous ones like pVWAP-D)

**What it is:** The "true average" price - where most volume traded

**Why it matters:**
- **Above VWAP** = Bulls in control
- **Below VWAP** = Bears in control
- Price loves to return to VWAP (like gravity)

**Example:** Price spikes to $68,000, but VWAP is at $66,000 → Likely pulls back to VWAP

---

### 🎯 Volume Profile (POC, VAH, VAL)
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600;">🎯 High Priority - Price Magnet Zones</span>

**What you see:** Three key lines

- **POC** (Point of Control) - Where MOST volume traded
- **VAH** (Value Area High) - Top of fair value zone
- **VAL** (Value Area Low) - Bottom of fair value zone

**Why they matter:**
- POC acts like a magnet (price returns here)
- Above VAH = Overbought territory
- Below VAL = Oversold territory

**Example:** Price at $69,000, POC is $67,000 → Expect pullback to $67,000

---

### 📈 Market Structure (HH/HL/LH/LL, BOS/CHoCH)
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📈 Trend Context - Uptrend vs Downtrend</span>

**What you see:** Labels at swing points

- **HH** (Higher High), **HL** (Higher Low) = Uptrend
- **LH** (Lower High), **LL** (Lower Low) = Downtrend
- **BOS** (Break of Structure) = Trend continues
- **CHoCH** (Change of Character) = Trend might reverse

**Example:**
```
Price makes: HL → HH → HL → HH (with BOS labels)
= Strong uptrend, keep buying dips
```

## How to Use It (3 Simple Steps)
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">🎓 Essential Learning - Start Here</span>

### Step 1: Pick Your Levels
<span style="color: #ff6b35; font-weight: 600;">⚠️ Critical - Don't Use All 39 At Once</span>

Don't turn on all 39 levels at once! Start simple:

**For scalping (5m-15m charts):**
- ✅ Session levels (Asian/Euro/NA)
- ✅ Daily VWAP
- ✅ Daily High/Low
- ✅ POC/VAH/VAL

**For day trading (1H-4H charts):**
- ✅ Daily + Weekly levels
- ✅ Daily + Weekly VWAP
- ✅ POC/VAH/VAL
- ✅ Market structure

**For swing trading (Daily charts):**
- ✅ Weekly + Monthly levels
- ✅ Weekly + Monthly VWAP
- ✅ Market structure
- ❌ Skip session levels (too granular)

---

### Step 2: Watch for Reactions
<span style="color: #a855f7; font-weight: 600;">👀 Key Concept - Bounce vs Break</span>

When price approaches a level:

**Bounce = Support/Resistance working**
→ Enter trades in the direction of the bounce

**Break = Level broken**
→ Enter trades in the direction of the break (but wait for retest!)

**Cluster = Multiple levels together**
→ These are HIGH PRIORITY zones (strongest reactions)

**Example:** Weekly Low + Monthly VWAP + POC all at $65,000 → MAJOR support level

---

### Step 3: Use Structure for Trend
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📊 Trend Filter - Combine Levels + Structure</span>

The structure labels (HH/HL/LH/LL) show you the current trend:

**Healthy Uptrend:**
```
HH → HL → HH → HL
     ↑        ↑
   (BOS)   (BOS)
Keep buying dips at HL
```

**Trend Exhaustion:**
```
HH → HL → HH → LH
              ↑
          (CHoCH) ← Warning!
Start watching for shorts
```

---

## Real Example (ES Futures)

**Setup:**
- Price: 4,520
- **Weekly High** = 4,550 (resistance above)
- **Daily VWAP** = 4,500 (support below)
- **POC** = 4,510 (middle magnet)
- Structure showing **HH** pattern (uptrend)

**The Trade:**
1. Price pulls back to Daily VWAP at 4,500
2. Holds above VWAP (bounce)
3. Example entry long at 4,502
4. Example target: Weekly High at 4,550 or POC at 4,510
5. Example stop: Below VWAP at 4,495

**Result:** Price rallies to 4,545 (near Weekly High) = +40 points profit

## ⚙️ Settings (Keep It Simple)
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Configuration Options</span>

You don't need to change much. Just show/hide what you use:

**Show/Hide Levels:**
- Turn off timeframes you don't watch
- Example: If swing trading, hide Daily levels (too fast)

**Colors:**
- Pick your favorite color scheme
- Keep it simple - too many colors = confusing

**Market Structure:**
- **Auto mode** works great (detects swing size automatically)
- Only use Manual mode if you want specific pivot lookback

**Most traders use default settings and just toggle which levels display.**

## Alerts (Set These!)

**Available alerts:**
1. **Daily High Touch** - Price reaches today's high (potential breakout watch)
2. **Daily Low Touch** - Price reaches today's low (support test)

**How to set:**
1. Click alarm icon on TradingView
2. Select "Janus Atlas v1.0"
3. Choose the level (Daily High or Daily Low)
4. Set to "Once Per Bar Close"

**Tip:** Combine with other indicator alerts for confluence. Example: "Daily High touch + Pentarch WRN" = late-cycle exhaustion watch

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">🚨 Critical Errors to Avoid</span>

❌ **Using ALL 39 levels at once**
→ ✅ Start with 5-7 levels. Add more as you learn.

❌ **Ignoring level clusters**
→ ✅ When multiple levels overlap = MOST important zones.

❌ **Trading without confirmation**
→ ✅ Wait for price to actually react at the level (bounce or break).

❌ **Wrong timeframe levels**
→ ✅ Scalpers use session/daily. Swing traders use weekly/monthly.

❌ **Forgetting about VWAP**
→ ✅ VWAP is your friend. Above = bullish bias, Below = bearish bias.

3. **Watch clusters** - Multiple levels together = strongest zones
4. **Use with structure** - Levels show WHERE, structure shows trend direction
5. **Be patient** - Wait for price to actually reach the level before trading
