## 📍 The Levels (What You Get)
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Level Types</span>
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">⭐ Core Feature - 39 Level Types Available</span>

### 📅 Timeframe Levels
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📊 Foundation - Daily/Weekly/Monthly Ranges</span>

**What you see:** Lines labeled dH, dL, WH, WL, MtH, etc.

**What they are:**
- **Daily High/Low** (dH/dL) - Today's range
- **Weekly High/Low** (WH/WL) - This week's range
- **Monthly High/Low** (MtH/MtL) - This month's range
- **Opens & Midpoints** - Reference points for each timeframe

**Why they matter:** Price reacts at these levels. They're like magnets - price either bounces off them or breaks through decisively.

**Example:** Bitcoin drops to Weekly Low at $65,000 → Often bounces back up (support)

---

### 🕐 Session Levels
<span style="color: #a855f7; font-weight: 600;">⏰ Scalper Essential - Asian/Euro/NA Ranges</span>

**What you see:** Lines labeled AH, AL (Asian), EH, EL (European), NAH, NAL (North American)

**What they are:** High and low of each trading session

**Why they matter:**
- Asian lows often get "swept" during London open (stop hunt)
- North American highs are key resistance for the day
- Session breaks = liquidity grabs

**Example:** Price spikes above Asian High at $66,500, immediately drops → Classic fake-out

---

### 📊 VWAP Lines
<span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600;">💰 Institutional Favorite - True Average Price</span>

**What you see:** Lines labeled VWAP-D, VWAP-W (and previous ones like pVWAP-D)

**What it is:** The "true average" price - where most volume traded

**Why it matters:**
- **Above VWAP** = Bulls in control
- **Below VWAP** = Bears in control
- Price loves to return to VWAP (like gravity)

**Example:** Price spikes to $68,000, but VWAP is at $66,000 → Likely pulls back to VWAP

---

### 🎯 Volume Profile (POC, VAH, VAL)
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600;">🎯 High Priority - Price Magnet Zones</span>

**What you see:** Three key lines

- **POC** (Point of Control) - Where MOST volume traded
- **VAH** (Value Area High) - Top of fair value zone
- **VAL** (Value Area Low) - Bottom of fair value zone

**Why they matter:**
- POC acts like a magnet (price returns here)
- Above VAH = Overbought territory
- Below VAL = Oversold territory

**Example:** Price at $69,000, POC is $67,000 → Expect pullback to $67,000

---

### 📈 Market Structure (HH/HL/LH/LL, BOS/CHoCH)
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📈 Trend Context - Uptrend vs Downtrend</span>

**What you see:** Labels at swing points

- **HH** (Higher High), **HL** (Higher Low) = Uptrend
- **LH** (Lower High), **LL** (Lower Low) = Downtrend
- **BOS** (Break of Structure) = Trend continues
- **CHoCH** (Change of Character) = Trend might reverse

**Example:**
```
Price makes: HL → HH → HL → HH (with BOS labels)
= Strong uptrend, keep buying dips
```

## Usage Patterns (3 Core Components)
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">🎓 Essential Learning - Start Here</span>

### Component 1: Level Selection
<span style="color: #ff6b35; font-weight: 600;">⚠️ Critical - Progressive Level Addition Recommended</span>

Starting with a subset of levels is recommended rather than enabling all 39 simultaneously:

**For scalping (5m-15m charts):**
- ✅ Session levels (Asian/Euro/NA)
- ✅ Daily VWAP
- ✅ Daily High/Low
- ✅ POC/VAH/VAL

**For day trading (1H-4H charts):**
- ✅ Daily + Weekly levels
- ✅ Daily + Weekly VWAP
- ✅ POC/VAH/VAL
- ✅ Market structure

**For swing trading (Daily charts):**
- ✅ Weekly + Monthly levels
- ✅ Weekly + Monthly VWAP
- ✅ Market structure
- ❌ Session levels (too granular for this timeframe)

---

### Component 2: Reaction Patterns
<span style="color: #a855f7; font-weight: 600;">👀 Key Concept - Bounce vs Break</span>

When price approaches a level, several patterns are commonly observed:

**Bounce = Support/Resistance pattern observed**
→ Trades in the direction of the bounce are common

**Break = Level penetration observed**
→ Trades in the direction of the break are common (retest patterns often awaited)

**Cluster = Multiple levels converging**
→ These zones are typically associated with stronger reactions

**Example:** Weekly Low + Monthly VWAP + POC all at $65,000 → Zone often interpreted as major support

---

### Component 3: Structure-Based Trend Analysis
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📊 Trend Filter - Combining Levels + Structure</span>

The structure labels (HH/HL/LH/LL) provide current trend context:

**Healthy Uptrend Pattern:**
```
HH → HL → HH → HL
     ↑        ↑
   (BOS)   (BOS)
Dip buying at HL is common
```

**Trend Exhaustion Pattern:**
```
HH → HL → HH → LH
              ↑
          (CHoCH) ← Warning indication
Short opportunities often evaluated
```

---

## Real Example (ES Futures)

**Setup:**
- Price: 4,520
- **Weekly High** = 4,550 (resistance above)
- **Daily VWAP** = 4,500 (support below)
- **POC** = 4,510 (middle magnet)
- Structure showing **HH** pattern (uptrend)

**The Trade:**
1. Price pulls back to Daily VWAP at 4,500
2. Holds above VWAP (bounce)
3. Example entry long at 4,502
4. Example target: Weekly High at 4,550 or POC at 4,510
5. Example stop: Below VWAP at 4,495

**Result:** Price rallies to 4,545 (near Weekly High) = +40 points profit

## ⚙️ Settings (Configuration Approach)
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Configuration Options</span>

Minimal configuration changes are typically required. Level visibility is the primary adjustment:

**Show/Hide Levels:**
- Unused timeframes can be disabled
- Example: Swing trading contexts often have Daily levels disabled (timeframe mismatch)

**Colors:**
- Color schemes are customizable
- Simpler color palettes are associated with clearer interpretation

**Market Structure:**
- **Auto mode** (detects swing size automatically) is the standard configuration
- Manual mode is available for specific pivot lookback requirements

**Most traders use default settings and adjust level visibility based on their analysis needs.**

---

## Alert Configuration

**Available alerts:**
1. **Daily High Touch** - Price reaches today's high (potential breakout observation point)
2. **Daily Low Touch** - Price reaches today's low (support test observation point)

**Configuration steps:**
1. Alarm icon on TradingView is clicked
2. "Janus Atlas v1.0" is selected
3. The desired level (Daily High or Daily Low) is chosen
4. "Once Per Bar Close" is set

**Common practice:** Combining with other indicator alerts for confluence is common. Example: "Daily High touch + Pentarch WRN" = late-cycle exhaustion observation point

---

## Common Pitfalls
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">🚨 Critical Learning Points</span>

❌ **Enabling all 39 levels simultaneously**
→ ✅ Starting with 5-7 levels and adding progressively is the recommended approach.

❌ **Overlooking level clusters**
→ ✅ Overlapping levels typically indicate the most significant zones.

❌ **Trading without confirmation patterns**
→ ✅ Awaiting actual price reaction at levels (bounce or break) is standard practice.

❌ **Timeframe mismatch**
→ ✅ Scalpers typically use session/daily levels. Swing traders typically use weekly/monthly.

❌ **Neglecting VWAP context**
→ ✅ VWAP positioning provides directional context. Above = bullish territory, Below = bearish territory.

**Q: What's the most important level?**
**A:** Depends on your timeframe:
- Scalpers: Daily VWAP + Session highs/lows
- Day traders: Daily High/Low + Weekly levels
- Swing traders: Weekly/Monthly levels

**Q: Do levels work on all instruments?**
**A:** Yes. Crypto, stocks, futures, forex - they all respect key levels.

**Q: What if price is between levels?**
**A:** Wait. Best trades happen AT levels, not between them. Patience = profits.

**Q: How do I know if a level is support or resistance?**
**A:**
- Price above level = Level is support (may bounce up)
- Price below level = Level is resistance (may bounce down)

**Q: Does it repaint?**
**A:** No. Once a level is drawn, it stays. What you see is what you get.

**Q: Can I use this with other indicators?**
**A:** Yes. Janus Atlas shows WHERE to trade. Use other indicators (like Pentarch) to show you WHEN to trade.
