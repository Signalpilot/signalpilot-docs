# SP — Context Stoch (SRSI+) — by Signal Pilot

**Time the move, skip the noise.**  
Context Stoch (SRSI+) is a smarter Stochastic RSI. It only prints a **Bull** (long) or **Bear** (short) tag when the bigger picture agrees.  
Tags appear **at bar close** — no repainting.

- **Indicator name in TradingView:** `Context Stoch (SRSI+)`
- **Panel:** its own panel (below price)

---

## What it does (plain English)

- **Waits for quality spots** instead of pinging every wiggle.  
- **Respects the bigger trend** so you’re not fighting it.  
- **Checks participation/pressure** to avoid weak crosses.  
- **Avoids bad areas** (e.g., shorting right into a strong demand zone).  
- **Stays calm in chop** with a built‑in cooldown.

---

## What you’ll see

- **Two lines** (the usual Stoch RSI look):
  - **Fast line** (%K)
  - **Slow line** (%D)
- **Soft bands** near the top and bottom (“stretched” areas).
- **Background tint** from a higher timeframe  
  (greenish = bullish bias, pinkish = bearish bias).
- **Boxed tags at bar close**:
  - **Bull** = a long idea
  - **Bear** = a short idea

> If a tag doesn’t show, the context wasn’t strong enough. That’s on purpose.

## Quick start (2 minutes)

1. **Add the indicator** to your chart. No settings needed.
2. **Create two alerts** (look for these in the alert “Condition” menu):
   - **`Context Stoch (SRSI+) | LONG`** — message auto‑filled
   - **`Context Stoch (SRSI+) | SHORT`** — message auto‑filled
3. Trade with context:
   - **Bull tag** near the **bottom band** + green background = stronger
   - **Bear tag** near the **top band** + pink background = stronger

> If the alert names look slightly different on your screen, pick the ones that end in **LONG** and **SHORT**. Same thing.

## How to use the tags

- A tag means the fast line crossed the slow line **near a band** and the bigger picture supported it.  
- Tags appear **only at bar close** — what you saw is what you got (no changes later).  
- The script filters out weak setups so you don’t have to.

---

## When a tag **won’t** appear (common reasons)

- The **higher timeframe** disagreed.  
- Not enough **push/participation** (volume/flow).  
- Too close to an opposite **zone/level** (e.g., shorting into demand).  
- You’re in a short **cooldown** after a recent flip.  
- The cross was **mid‑range** (not close to a band).

*(Fewer pings, better quality.)*

## Alerts & simple automation

- Set exactly these two alerts:
  - `Context Stoch (SRSI+) | LONG`  
  - `Context Stoch (SRSI+) | SHORT`
- If you use a bot/webhook, a simple rule of thumb:
  - Only act when the **tag** fires **and** the **background color** agrees.

---

## Good habits

- Prefer tags that **agree with the background**.  
- Prefer tags **near a band**, not in the middle.  
- Don’t short into obvious **support** or long into **resistance**.  
- Always use a stop; this is a **timing tool**, not a promise.

## FAQ

**Does it repaint?**  
No. Tags print **only at bar close**. The higher‑timeframe check also waits for its candle to close.

**Which markets/timeframes?**  
Any. Crypto, FX, stocks, indices, commodities — intraday or higher.

**I see “Bear 4 / Bear 7” somewhere else — is that this?**  
No. Context Stoch (SRSI+) prints only **“Bull”** and **“Bear”** boxed tags (no numbers).  
Those numbered bears are from a different study.

## Changelog (high level)

- Initial release under the new name **Context Stoch (SRSI+)**:  
  non‑repainting **Bull/Bear** tags, higher‑timeframe bias tint, soft bands, and ready‑to‑use LONG/SHORT alerts.
