# üö¶ <span class="signal-pilot-brand">Signal Pilot</span> Suite Trading Workflow

The <span class="signal-pilot-brand">Signal Pilot</span> Suite provides comprehensive functionality: **event detection**, **levels**, **volume confirmation**, **momentum**, and **multi-symbol scanning**. These components can be combined into a clean, systematic workflow.

---

## üí° The Core Philosophy
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600;">Key Principle</span>

**Trading with confluence, not single signals.**

Each indicator in the <span class="signal-pilot-brand">Signal Pilot</span> Suite serves a specific purpose. Combining 2-3 indicators for trade setups is associated with improved win rates.

---

## üéØ Recommended Combinations
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Indicator Setups</span>

### üèÜ The Trinity (Best All-Around)

**Pentarch + Janus Atlas + Volume Oracle**

**Why it works:**
- **Pentarch** = Event detection (IGN, CAP, WRN, BDN, TD)
- **Janus Atlas** = Key levels (HTF, session, VWAP, structure)
- **Volume Oracle** = Volume confirmation + position management

**Common workflow pattern:**

- Traders observe Pentarch events (IGN for potential longs, CAP for potential shorts)
- Event location is evaluated using Janus Atlas key levels
- Volume confirmation is assessed via Volume Oracle spike detection
- Position entries often use Volume Oracle's position management system
- Exit targets commonly include next Janus level or opposite Pentarch event

**Best for:** Swing traders, position traders

---

### üíé The Divergence Hunter

**Harmonic Oscillator + Plutus Flow + Janus Atlas**

**Why it works:**
- **Harmonic Oscillator** = Momentum divergence detection
- **Plutus Flow** = OBV divergence detection
- **Janus Atlas** = Key levels for divergence context

**Common workflow pattern:**

- Traders monitor both Harmonic Oscillator and Plutus Flow for simultaneous divergences
- Divergence context is evaluated at Janus Atlas major levels (Weekly high, Monthly VWAP, etc.)
- Price confirmation is observed (reversal candle, break of structure)
- Entries commonly occur after confirmation appears
- Targets often include opposite Janus level

**Best for:** Reversal traders, divergence specialists

---

### üéØ The Scalper Setup

**Janus Atlas (Session Levels + VWAP) + Volume Oracle + Pentarch (NanoFlow)**

**Why it works:**
- **Janus Atlas** = Intraday levels (session highs/lows, VWAP)
- **Volume Oracle** = Volume spike detection (scalping mode)
- **Pentarch** = NanoFlow crosses for micro-trends

**Common workflow pattern:**

- Session levels are identified on Janus (Asian/Euro/NA ranges)
- Volume Oracle spikes are observed near session levels
- Pentarch NanoFlow crosses are monitored for directional confirmation
- Entries often occur promptly when confluence appears
- Targets commonly include Daily VWAP or opposite session level
- Exits typically occur within 5-15 bars (quick scalping timeframe)

**Best for:** Scalpers, day traders on 5m-15m charts

---

### üìä The Multi-Asset Scanner

**Augury Grid + Pentarch + Janus Atlas**

**Why it works:**
- **Augury Grid** = Scan 8 symbols for MACD crosses with confluence
- **Pentarch** = Confirm events on selected symbol
- **Janus Atlas** = Entry/exit levels

**Common workflow pattern:**

- Augury Grid scans the watchlist continuously for opportunities
- Traders filter for Elite/Premium quality signals (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê or ‚≠ê‚≠ê ratings)
- Individual symbol charts are reviewed when high-quality signals appear
- Pentarch is evaluated for recent events (IGN) or developing setups
- Janus Atlas levels are assessed for proximity and confluence
- Entries commonly occur when multiple indicators align at key levels
- Grid continues monitoring for additional opportunities during active trades

**Best for:** Multi-asset traders, swing traders with large watchlists

---

### üîÑ The Complete System

**Omnideck + Janus Atlas**

**Why it works:**
- **Omnideck** = 10 systems in one (TD, Squeeze, EMA, ST, BMSB, Regime, SDZ, Patterns, etc.)
- **Janus Atlas** = Precision levels

**Common workflow pattern:**

- Omnideck Regime Box displays current market bias (Green/Red/Gray)
- Traders monitor for confluence signals across multiple systems:
  - TD 9 + Squeeze break + EMA event + Liquidity sweep = Maximum confluence
- Janus Atlas is evaluated to confirm signals occur at key levels
- Entries often occur when 3+ Omnideck systems align with price levels
- Exits commonly include Omnideck opposite signals or Janus target levels

**Best for:** Traders wanting comprehensive analysis in minimal screen space

## üìà The "One Chart" Setup
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Minimalist Approach</span>

If you only want to load indicators on a single chart:

**Minimal Setup (3 indicators):**
1. Pentarch (events)
2. Janus Atlas (levels)
3. Volume Oracle (volume + management)

**Balanced Setup (4 indicators):**
1. Omnideck (replaces Pentarch, includes 10 systems)
2. Janus Atlas (levels)
3. Harmonic Oscillator (momentum)
4. Plutus Flow (volume)

**Power Setup (all 7 indicators):**
- Augury Grid on main chart (scan mode)
- When Grid displays setup, symbol opened in new window
- Pentarch, Janus, Volume Oracle, Harmonic, Plutus loaded on new window
- Omnideck used as backup/confirmation
