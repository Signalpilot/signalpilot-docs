# SP — Key Anchors (Key Levels Suite) — by Signal Pilot

**Plain English:** Key Anchors draws the price levels traders actually watch:
- High/Low for the **Day, Week, Month, Quarter**
- Your own **Session** Open/High/Low/Mid (up to 3 sessions you choose)
- **VWAP** (the “fair price” line) for **Day / Week / Month**

It’s clean and once a candle closes, the past doesn’t change (**no repaint**).
Educational use only — not financial advice.

## TL;DR — Quick Start (60 seconds)

1. Add the script to your TradingView chart.  
2. Open settings → **Turn ON**:  
   - **Daily High (dH)** and **Daily Low (dL)**  
   - **Daily VWAP** (optional but great for intraday)  
3. Zoom out a bit. You’ll see simple horizontal lines with short labels like `dH`, `wL`, `mVWAP`.
4. If it looks crowded, turn OFF what you don’t need. Less is more.

**Optional alerts (2 mins):**  
Right‑click chart → **Add alert…** → Condition = this script → pick
“**SP: dH touch**” or “**SP: dL touch**” → Create.

## What the lines mean (no jargon)

- **High (H):** Highest price of the period (day/week/month/quarter).  
- **Low (L):** Lowest price of the period.  
- **Mid:** Halfway between that period’s High and Low.  
- **Session O/H/L/Mid:** Levels inside *your* trading hours (you set the times).  
- **VWAP (D/W/M):** “Average price paid,” weighted by volume — a fair‑value line many pros watch.

> Think of **High/Low** as **ceilings/floors** and **VWAP** as the **fair price** magnet.

## Why you’ll care

- **Fast context:** Instantly see if price is near today’s high, last week’s low, or the monthly VWAP.  
- **Better timing:** Price often **reacts** at these lines (stall, bounce, or break).  
- **Clean alerts:** Get pinged when price **touches** big levels (daily/weekly/monthly highs or lows).

---

## Simple ways to use it (ideas, not signals)

- **Bounce idea:** Price tests **dL** (daily low) and slows → look for a bounce back toward **VWAP**.  
- **Breakout idea:** Price **pushes through** **wH** (weekly high) and holds → momentum may continue.  
- **Mean‑revert idea:** Far above/below **VWAP** → price often re‑checks VWAP.

Always use your own plan and risk controls. These are just ideas.

## Buttons you’ll see (in plain words)

### Main switches
- **HTF Levels:** Show big‑picture lines (Day/Week/Month/Quarter).
- **Session Levels:** Show lines for your trading hours (Open/High/Low/Mid).
- **VWAP Levels (centers):** Show VWAP for Day/Week/Month (no bands = cleaner chart).

### HTF toggles (per timeframe)
- Turn **O / H / L / Mid** on/off.  
  **Start with H & L only** — they’re the most useful.

### Sessions (up to 3)
- Set your local session hours (e.g., `0930-1600` for US cash).  
- Turn on **O/H/L/Mid** if you want those session‑specific lines.  
- **Note:** Session lines show *during* that session and reset next session.

### VWAP
- **Daily VWAP:** Great for intraday.  
- **Weekly/Monthly VWAP:** Nice for swing context.

### Appearance
- **Line type:** Regular / Dashed / Dotted  
- **Width:** Make lines thicker if you want  
- **Offsets:** How far lines/labels extend left/right  
- **Label size:** Tiny / Small / Normal

## Alerts you can use (ready to go)

- **SP: dH touch** — Price touched **Daily High**  
- **SP: dL touch** — Price touched **Daily Low**  
- **SP: wH touch** — Price touched **Weekly High**  
- **SP: wL touch** — Price touched **Weekly Low**  
- **SP: mH touch** — Price touched **Monthly High**  
- **SP: mL touch** — Price touched **Monthly Low**

These only fire once the candle closes (no repaint surprises).

## FAQs (really simple)

**Q: What does “no repaint” mean?**  
A: Once a candle closes, the past stays put. Yesterday’s lines won’t rewrite tomorrow.

**Q: Which lines should I start with?**  
A: **Daily High/Low** + **Daily VWAP**. Add weekly/monthly later if you want.

**Q: My chart is messy — help!**  
A: Turn OFF what you don’t need. Keep it to a few key lines.

**Q: Why did today’s high move intraday?**  
A: The **day isn’t over**. Today’s high/low update as new highs/lows happen. After the day ends, they lock.

**Q: Is this buy/sell signals?**  
A: No. It’s a **map** to important prices — not a signal generator.

## Troubleshooting

- **No lines?** Make sure the toggles (H/L/VWAP) are ON.  
- **Wrong session times?** Adjust the session hours to match your market.  
- **Too many objects?** Turn off unused timeframes or sessions.
