# SP — RSI Triad Confirm (SPRSI‑U) — by Signal Pilot
**Beginner‑friendly guide (GitHub README) 👶**  
*TradingView · Pine v6 · Non‑repainting on candle close 🔒*

---

## 🎯 What it does (one sentence)
**Helps you catch momentum turns with fewer fakeouts** by watching three RSI lines, spotting divergence, and only showing **BUY/SELL** when extra “green lights” agree. ✅

---

## 🧭 What you’ll see on the chart
- 🧵 **Three RSI lines** (Fast, Base, Slow) in one pane.  
- 🔀 **Green/Red divergence lines** with labels like “Bull 10” / “Bear 12” (that number is strength out of 20).  
- 🟢 **BUY ▲** and 🔴 **SELL ▼** markers when everything lines up.  
- 🩶 A grey band around RSI **30–70** to show normal vs stretched zones.

> 🔒 **No repainting:** Signals lock in at **candle close** and won’t jump or vanish later.  
> ⏱️ Higher‑timeframe filters also wait for their candle to close before they count.

---

## 🧠 How it decides (simple 3‑step logic)
1) 🔎 **Divergence:** Price pushes one way, RSI disagrees → early heads‑up.  
2) 🚦 **Triad check:** The **Base** RSI steps out of the “rails” made by the Fast/Slow lines in the same direction → follow‑through.  
3) ✅ **Confluence:** Optional extra green lights: **OBV** trend, **Stoch RSI** timing, **ATR** (enough movement), and **HTF/Weekly** trend bias.

If steps 1–3 happen within a short window, you’ll see **BUY** (bullish) or **SELL** (bearish). 📬

## ⚡ Quick start (2 minutes)
1) ➕ Add the script to your TradingView chart (after your SignalPilot invite is active).  
2) 🙌 **Leave defaults** for your first session.  
3) 🕒 Choose a timeframe:
   - **Scalp:** 1–5m
   - **Intraday:** 15–60m
   - **Swing:** 4H–1D
4) 👀 Wait for a fresh **divergence** line; if a **BUY/SELL** prints soon after, study that example in replay.  
5) 🧪 Practice first; add alerts when you’re comfortable.

**🧼 Clean‑up mode (fewer trades)**  
- Turn **OBV = ON** and **Stoch RSI = ON**  
- Set **Min Regime Score = 50+**  
- Keep **FlipGuard = ON**

**📈 Trend‑friendly**  
- **HTF Filter = ON** (use 1H if you’re on 5–15m, 4H if you’re on 1H)  
- **Weekly Assist = ON** for swing charts

**🌬️ Volatility guard**  
- **ATR gate = ON**  
- Set **Min ATR%** around **0.25–0.35** in slow markets

## ❓ FAQ (really short)

**Does it repaint?**  
🟢 No. Signals finalize at candle close. HTF/Weekly checks also wait for their candle to close.

**Which markets/timeframes?**  
🌍 Any symbol on TradingView (crypto, stocks, FX, indices), from scalps to swings.

**Too many signals?**  
🔧 Raise **Min Divergence Strength** and **Min Regime Score**; keep **FlipGuard ON**. Consider **OBV** and **ATR** gates.

**Too few signals?**  
🎚️ Lower **Min Regime Score** slightly (e.g., 40 → 35) or raise the **divergence window** (20 → 25–30). Keep **FlipGuard** (reduce, don’t disable).

**What do 70/30 mean?**  
🧭 They’re RSI “overbought/oversold” guide rails—price *can* still run beyond them.
