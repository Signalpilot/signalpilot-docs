# Janus Atlas v3.12.2 - Your Market Map

## What Does It Do?

Janus Atlas shows you **every important level on your chart** - all at once. Think of it like having a professional trading floor's price levels marked for you automatically.

**Best for:** Everyone - from scalpers to swing traders

---

## The Levels (What You Get)

### üìÖ Timeframe Levels

**What you see:** Lines labeled dH, dL, WH, WL, MtH, etc.

**What they are:**
- **Daily High/Low** (dH/dL) - Today's range
- **Weekly High/Low** (WH/WL) - This week's range
- **Monthly High/Low** (MtH/MtL) - This month's range
- **Opens & Midpoints** - Reference points for each timeframe

**Why they matter:** Price reacts at these levels. They're like magnets - price either bounces off them or breaks through decisively.

**Example:** Bitcoin drops to Weekly Low at $65,000 ‚Üí Often bounces back up (support)

---

### üïê Session Levels

**What you see:** Lines labeled AH, AL (Asian), EH, EL (European), NAH, NAL (North American)

**What they are:** High and low of each trading session

**Why they matter:**
- Asian lows often get "swept" during London open (stop hunt)
- North American highs are key resistance for the day
- Session breaks = liquidity grabs

**Example:** Price spikes above Asian High at $66,500, immediately drops ‚Üí Classic fake-out

---

### üìä VWAP Lines

**What you see:** Lines labeled VWAP-D, VWAP-W (and previous ones like pVWAP-D)

**What it is:** The "true average" price - where most volume traded

**Why it matters:**
- **Above VWAP** = Bulls in control
- **Below VWAP** = Bears in control
- Price loves to return to VWAP (like gravity)

**Example:** Price spikes to $68,000, but VWAP is at $66,000 ‚Üí Likely pulls back to VWAP

---

### üéØ Volume Profile (POC, VAH, VAL)

**What you see:** Three key lines

- **POC** (Point of Control) - Where MOST volume traded
- **VAH** (Value Area High) - Top of fair value zone
- **VAL** (Value Area Low) - Bottom of fair value zone

**Why they matter:**
- POC acts like a magnet (price returns here)
- Above VAH = Overbought territory
- Below VAL = Oversold territory

**Example:** Price at $69,000, POC is $67,000 ‚Üí Expect pullback to $67,000

---

### üìà Market Structure (HH/HL/LH/LL, BOS/CHoCH)

**What you see:** Labels at swing points

- **HH** (Higher High), **HL** (Higher Low) = Uptrend
- **LH** (Lower High), **LL** (Lower Low) = Downtrend
- **BOS** (Break of Structure) = Trend continues
- **CHoCH** (Change of Character) = Trend might reverse

**Example:**
```
Price makes: HL ‚Üí HH ‚Üí HL ‚Üí HH (with BOS labels)
= Strong uptrend, keep buying dips
```

---

## How to Use It (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Pick Your Levels

Don't turn on all 39 levels at once! Start simple:

**For scalping (5m-15m charts):**
- ‚úÖ Session levels (Asian/Euro/NA)
- ‚úÖ Daily VWAP
- ‚úÖ Daily High/Low
- ‚úÖ POC/VAH/VAL

**For day trading (1H-4H charts):**
- ‚úÖ Daily + Weekly levels
- ‚úÖ Daily + Weekly VWAP
- ‚úÖ POC/VAH/VAL
- ‚úÖ Market structure

**For swing trading (Daily charts):**
- ‚úÖ Weekly + Monthly levels
- ‚úÖ Weekly + Monthly VWAP
- ‚úÖ Market structure
- ‚ùå Skip session levels (too granular)

---

### Step 2: Watch for Reactions

When price approaches a level:

**Bounce = Support/Resistance working**
‚Üí Enter trades in the direction of the bounce

**Break = Level broken**
‚Üí Enter trades in the direction of the break (but wait for retest!)

**Cluster = Multiple levels together**
‚Üí These are HIGH PRIORITY zones (strongest reactions)

**Example:** Weekly Low + Monthly VWAP + POC all at $65,000 ‚Üí MAJOR support level

---

### Step 3: Use Structure for Trend

The structure labels (HH/HL/LH/LL) tell you the current trend:

**Healthy Uptrend:**
```
HH ‚Üí HL ‚Üí HH ‚Üí HL
     ‚Üë        ‚Üë
   (BOS)   (BOS)
Keep buying dips at HL
```

**Trend Exhaustion:**
```
HH ‚Üí HL ‚Üí HH ‚Üí LH
              ‚Üë
          (CHoCH) ‚Üê Warning!
Start watching for shorts
```

---

## Real Example (ES Futures)

**Setup:**
- Price: 4,520
- **Weekly High** = 4,550 (resistance above)
- **Daily VWAP** = 4,500 (support below)
- **POC** = 4,510 (middle magnet)
- Structure showing **HH** pattern (uptrend)

**The Trade:**
1. Price pulls back to Daily VWAP at 4,500
2. Holds above VWAP (bounce)
3. Example entry long at 4,502
4. Example target: Weekly High at 4,550 or POC at 4,510
5. Example stop: Below VWAP at 4,495

**Result:** Price rallies to 4,545 (near Weekly High) = +40 points profit

---

## Settings (Keep It Simple)

You don't need to change much. Just show/hide what you use:

**Show/Hide Levels:**
- Turn off timeframes you don't watch
- Example: If swing trading, hide Daily levels (too fast)

**Colors:**
- Pick your favorite color scheme
- Keep it simple - too many colors = confusing

**Market Structure:**
- **Auto mode** works great (detects swing size automatically)
- Only use Manual mode if you want specific pivot lookback

**Most traders use default settings and just toggle which levels display.**

---

## Alerts (Set These!)

**Available alerts:**
1. **Daily High Touch** - Price reaches today's high (potential breakout watch)
2. **Daily Low Touch** - Price reaches today's low (support test)

**How to set:**
1. Click alarm icon on TradingView
2. Select "Janus Atlas v3.12.2"
3. Choose the level (Daily High or Daily Low)
4. Set to "Once Per Bar Close"

**Tip:** Combine with other indicator alerts for confluence. Example: "Daily High touch + Pentarch WRN" = potential top

---

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

‚ùå **Using ALL 39 levels at once**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Start with 5-7 levels. Add more as you learn.

‚ùå **Ignoring level clusters**
‚Üí ‚úÖ When multiple levels overlap = MOST important zones.

‚ùå **Trading without confirmation**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Wait for price to actually react at the level (bounce or break).

‚ùå **Wrong timeframe levels**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Scalpers use session/daily. Swing traders use weekly/monthly.

‚ùå **Forgetting about VWAP**
‚Üí ‚úÖ VWAP is your friend. Above = bullish bias, Below = bearish bias.

4. **Use with structure** - Levels show WHERE, structure shows trend direction
5. **Be patient** - Wait for price to actually reach the level before trading
