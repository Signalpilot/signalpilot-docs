## The 10 Systems (Choose What You Need)
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">⭐ 10 Systems Combined - Choose Your Mix</span>

### 1. 🔢 TD Sequential - Exhaustion Counter
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📊 Exhaustion Detection - 9-Count System</span>

**What you see:** Green numbers 1-9 below bars, Red numbers 1-9 above bars

**What it means:**
- **Green 9** = Price has been falling for extended period, potential reversal UP
- **Red 9** = Price has been rising for extended period, potential reversal DOWN

**Common interpretation:** At 9-count, many traders watch for potential reversal confirmation

**Example:** Price falling for 9 bars (shows green 9 at $100) → Potential long entry signal, early-cycle conditions may be developing

---

### 2. 💥 Squeeze - Breakout Detector
<span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600;">⚡ Volatility Breakout - Compression to Expansion</span>

**What you see:**
- **Red dots on price** = Volatility compressing (big move developing)
- **Green arrow ↑** = Bullish breakout indication
- **Red arrow ↓** = Bearish breakdown indication

**Common pattern observation:**
1. Red dots appear (squeeze forming)
2. Multiple dots cluster (3-5+ dots = larger move potential)
3. Arrow fires → Directional breakout indicated

**Example:** 5 red dots appear, then green arrow at $102 → Potential long entry signal, explosive move indicated

---

### 3. 💧 Liquidity Sweeps - Stop Hunt Detector
<span style="color: #a855f7; font-weight: 600;">🎯 Smart Money Detection - Liquidity Grabs</span>

**What you see:**
- **LL tag** = Lower Low sweep (potential fake breakdown)
- **HH tag** = Higher High sweep (potential fake breakout)

**What it means:**
- Price spiked to grab stops, then immediately reversed
- Classic "trap" move pattern

**Common interpretation:**
- **LL sweep** → Potential bullish reversal signal (stop hunt completed)
- **HH sweep** → Potential bearish reversal signal (fake breakout)

**Example:** Price drops to $98 (LL tag), immediately bounces to $102 → Classic stop hunt pattern, potential long signal

---

### 4. 📊 EMA Trio - The Big Three Moving Averages
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📈 Trend Foundation - Classic Moving Averages</span>

**What you see:** Three lines - EMA 50 (fast), EMA 100 (medium), EMA 200 (slow)

**Key signals:**
- **Golden Cross (GC)** = Fast crosses above slow (bullish indication)
- **Death Cross (DC)** = Fast crosses below slow (bearish indication)
- **Pullback (PB)** = Price touches EMA then bounces (potential entry pattern)

**Example:** Price above all 3 EMAs (50>100>200) = Strong uptrend structure, bullish bias common

---

### 5. 🎯 SuperTrend - Trend Confirmation
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600;">🎯 Trend Filter - Directional Bias</span>

**What you see:**
- **Green ribbon** = Bullish trend (long bias typical)
- **Red ribbon** = Bearish trend (short bias typical)

**Why it helps:** Provides clear trend direction. Trading with the ribbon color is a common practice.

**Example:** Green ribbon + TD 9 green = Oversold in uptrend → Potential strong buy signal

---

### 6. 📉 BMSB - Bull Market Support Band
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📉 Dynamic Support - Uptrend Bounce Zone</span>

**What you see:** Two lines close together (20 SMA + 21 EMA)

**What it is:** The "support zone" commonly used in uptrends

**Common pattern:**
- In uptrend: Many traders watch for bounces when price touches BMSB
- Price breaks below BMSB = Trend may be weakening

**Example:** Stock in uptrend pulls back to BMSB at $105, bounces → Potential buy-the-dip signal

---

### 7. 🌈 Regime Box - Market Mood Background
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600;">🎯 MOST IMPORTANT - Your Bias Filter</span>

**What you see:**
- **Green background** = Bullish regime (long bias typical)
- **Red background** = Bearish regime (short bias typical)
- **Gray background** = Neutral/choppy (selectivity common)

**Why it helps:** Primary "bias filter." Trading with the background color is standard practice.

**Example:** Regime green + Squeeze arrow up = Maximum conviction long signal

---

### 8. 📦 Supply/Demand Zones - Institutional Levels
<span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600;">📦 Price Magnet Zones - High Reaction Areas</span>

**What you see:**
- **Green boxes** = Demand zones (support, bounce potential)
- **Red boxes** = Supply zones (resistance, rejection potential)
- **Stars ⭐⭐⭐** = Quality rating (more stars = stronger zone)

**Common approach:**
1. Watch for price to reach zone
2. Observe reaction (bounce or break)
3. Entry consideration based on reaction direction

**Example:** Price drops to ⭐⭐⭐ demand zone at $100, forms hammer → Potential long entry signal

---

### 9. 🕯️ Candlestick Patterns - Classic Reversals
<span style="color: #a855f7; font-weight: 600;">🕯️ Pattern Recognition - 16 Classic Patterns</span>

**What you see:** Labels like "HAM" (Hammer), "BE" (Bullish Engulfing), "SS" (Shooting Star)

**What they are:** 16 classic potential reversal patterns detected automatically

**Common interpretation:** Pattern + other confirmations = Potential higher-probability setup

**Example:** Shooting Star at supply zone + TD 9 red = Potential late-cycle exhaustion, example short setup

---

### 10. 🎛️ Meta Tools - Everything Working Together
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">🎛️ System Integration - Harmony & Confluence</span>

**What it is:** Behind-the-scenes integration that makes all systems work in harmony

**Example:** When all systems align (Regime green + Squeeze up + TD exhaustion + Demand zone + Hammer) = ELITE setup

---

## How to Use It (Don't Overwhelm Yourself!)
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">🎓 Essential Learning - Progressive Approach</span>

### Step 1: Start Simple (Beginner)
<span style="color: #ff6b35; font-weight: 600;">⚠️ Critical - Don't Use All 10 At Once</span>

Don't turn on all 10 systems at once! Start with 3-4:

**Recommended starter combo:**
- ✅ TD Sequential (exhaustion signals)
- ✅ Squeeze Detector (breakout arrows)
- ✅ EMA Trio (trend context)
- ✅ Regime Box (bias filter)
- ❌ Other systems (add later)

---

### Step 2: Follow the Hierarchy
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">📊 Analysis Order - Top-Down Approach</span>

**Common evaluation order:**

1. **Regime Box** (background color) = Directional bias
2. **EMA Trio / BMSB** = Trend structure
3. **TD / Squeeze / Sweeps** = Entry timing

**Example:**
1. Regime = Green (bullish)
2. Price above BMSB (uptrend confirmed)
3. TD 9 green (oversold)
4. Squeeze arrow fires up
5. = Potential long entry (everything aligned)

---

### Step 3: Use Zones as Context
<span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600;">💰 Quality Filter - Zones Increase Probability</span>

Signals at Supply/Demand zones often show higher probability

**Example:**
- Regular signal (no zone) = 55% win rate typical
- Signal at ⭐⭐⭐ zone = 75% win rate typical

Signals at key zones are commonly preferred.

---

## Real Example (Bitcoin)

**Setup:**
- Price: $64,000, falling
- **Regime Box** = Red (bearish... but check for reversal)
- **TD Sequential** = Green 9 (oversold exhaustion)
- **Demand Zone** ⭐⭐⭐ at $63,500
- **Liquidity Sweep** = LL tag at $63,200
- **Hammer** pattern forms

**The Trade:**
1. Price sweeps $63,200 (LL liquidity sweep)
2. Bounces into demand zone
3. TD shows green 9 (exhaustion)
4. Hammer indicates potential reversal
5. Common entry consideration: Long at $63,800
6. Typical stop placement: Below zone at $63,000

**Result:**
- Price rallies to $68,000
- Regime flips to green at $65,000 (confirmation)
- Exit at next supply zone = $4,200 gain per coin (6.6% gain)

---

## Settings (Keep It Simple)

**System Toggles:**
Each of the 10 systems can be turned on/off independently

**My recommendation:**
- Week 1: TD + Squeeze + EMA + Regime
- Week 2: Add BMSB + SuperTrend
- Week 3: Add Zones + Patterns
- Week 4: Use all 10 once you understand each

**Colors:**
Customize to your preference, but keep it clean

**Regime Mode:**
- Conservative = Fewer but stronger signals
- Balanced = Default (recommended)
- Aggressive = More signals, requires more filtering

---

## Alerts (Set These!)

**Must-have alerts:**
1. **TD Buy 9** = Oversold exhaustion
2. **TD Sell 9** = Overbought exhaustion
3. **Squeeze Break Up** = Bullish explosion
4. **Squeeze Break Down** = Bearish explosion
5. **Golden Cross** = Major bullish signal
6. **Death Cross** = Major bearish signal

**How to set:**
1. Click alarm icon
2. Select "Omnideck v1.0"
3. Choose which signal
4. Set to "Once Per Bar Close"

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">🚨 Critical Errors to Avoid</span>

❌ **Using all 10 systems at once as a beginner**
→ ✅ Start with 3-4 systems, add more as you learn each one

❌ **Ignoring the Regime Box**
→ ✅ Regime = Directional bias. Checking it first is a common practice.

❌ **Trading every signal**
→ ✅ Best signals typically have multiple confirmations (TD 9 + Sweep + Zone + Pattern)

❌ **Taking signals against the trend**
→ ✅ Regime green + bullish signals = High quality. Regime green + bearish signals = Often skipped.

❌ **Forgetting about Supply/Demand zones**
→ ✅ Signals at zones = Much higher success rate
