# SP — Screener (Screener Table) — by Signal Pilot

**What it is (one line):**  
A simple on‑chart **table** that watches up to **8 markets** (any symbols, any timeframes) and tells you when a fresh **bullish (↑)** or **bearish (↓)** signal just happened — plus a quick “how strong is it?” **Score**.

---

## TL;DR — How to use it

1) **Add to chart** (it’s an overlay).  
2) In settings, pick up to **8 rows** (each row = one *symbol + timeframe*).  
3) Choose a **table size** and screen corner.  
4) Trade your own plan. This is a **dashboard**, not a “buy/sell” robot.

> This file shows info on the chart. It does **not** place trades and does **not** send alerts by itself.

## What you’ll see (each row)

- **Ticker** — e.g., `BTCUSDT · 5` (symbol + timeframe).
- **Signal** — `↑ Bullish` / `↓ Bearish` / `—` (none yet).
- **Status (Age)** — how long since that signal fired (e.g., `12m`, `2h`, `1d`).
- **TP1** — a simple first target based on recent volatility. Think: “reasonable first stoplight.”
- **Gauss Ribbon** — quick read of trend & stretch:
  - **Inside** = normal zone  
  - **Outside** = stretched/extended  
  - **Bullish / Bearish** = trend direction
- **Score (0–100)** — higher = more green lights behind the scenes.
- **P&L** — how the **last signal** has done since it fired (not your account P&L).

> **Fresh & nearby** often means: Signal arrow is new, **Age** is small, **Score** is decent, **Inside** is preferred.

## “I don’t want to learn settings.” Cool — use these.

- Leave everything **ON** under “Accuracy Filters.” They keep junk signals out.
- Start with **Default Score = 60**.
- **Intraday (fast)**: mostly 3m–15m timeframes; if it’s noisy, bump Score to **65–70**.  
- **Swing (slower)**: 1H–4H–1D rows; Score around **55–60** is fine.

You can always add/remove rows later.

## Reading a row (3 quick examples)

**Example A — Fresh bullish idea**
- `↑ Bullish` • **Age:** `9m` • **Score:** `72` • **Gauss:** `Inside | Bullish`
- Plain English: “A new up signal just fired, not old, strong backing, and not stretched.”

**Example B — Caution on a chase**
- `↑ Bullish` • **Age:** `3h` • **Score:** `61` • **Gauss:** `Outside | Bullish`
- Plain English: “Up signal, but it’s older and price looks stretched. Don’t assume it continues.”

**Example C — Nothing to do**
- `—` • **Age:** `—` • **Score:** `—`
- Plain English: “No qualified signal yet. Move along.”

## Setup (step‑by‑step)

1) **Rows**  
   - For each row, pick a **Symbol** (e.g., `BINANCE:BTCUSDT`) and a **Timeframe** (e.g., `15` for 15‑minute).
2) **Table Options**
   - **Show Table**: keep ON.
   - **Position**: pick a corner you like.
   - **Size**: Tiny / Small / Normal / Large.
   - **Show Score**: ON if using Normal/Large (recommended).
3) **Accuracy Filters** (leave ON unless you know why you’re changing them)
   - These are simple “green lights” that aim to avoid weak signals.

## What makes a signal appear? (no jargon)

A signal shows only when **several checks agree**:
- Momentum flips up/down (the script checks this for you).
- Trend, higher timeframe, volume push, and “not too stretched” checks look OK.
- The **Score** (0–100) meets your **Min Score** (default 60).

If any of those don’t pass, you’ll just see `—` (no signal). That’s normal.

**Good to know:**  
Signals **lock in at candle close** on the timeframe for that row.  
Until the candle closes, things can wobble; once it closes, it’s final.

---

## Cheat sheet (keep it simple)

- **Score**  
  - 70+ = strong agreement  
  - 60–69 = decent  
  - <60 = filtered out (by default)
- **Age**  
  - Minutes = fresh  
  - Hours/Days = getting old
- **Gauss: Inside vs Outside**  
  - **Inside** = normal zone (healthier)  
  - **Outside** = stretched; be careful chasing
- **P&L**  
  - How the last signal has performed so far. Not your personal P&L.

## Common questions

**Q: Can I just buy every ↑ and sell every ↓?**  
A: No. Treat this as a **radar**, not a rulebook. Always use your own plan and risk controls.

**Q: Why do some rows never signal?**  
A: The **filters** are doing their job. Either no good setup yet or your **Min Score** is too high.

**Q: Why is TP1 far/close?**  
A: It adjusts to recent volatility. Wild markets → bigger TP1.

**Q: Does this repaint?**  
A: No. Signals finalize on candle close and don’t disappear later.

**Q: Does this send alerts?**  
A: This table doesn’t. It’s for **visual scanning**. Use other parts of your workflow for alerts.

## When to change settings (only if needed)

- Too many signals? **Increase Min Score** (e.g., from 60 → 65).  
- Still too chatty on tiny timeframes? Keep filters ON and use **slightly higher TF**.  
- Too few signals on higher TFs? **Lower Min Score** a little (e.g., 60 → 55).

---

## What this is NOT

- Not a trade copier.  
- Not financial advice.  
- Not a full market scanner across thousands of tickers (it shows **8 rows you choose**).

---

## Safety

- Use stops and position sizing.  
- One signal isn’t certainty.  
- News, liquidity, and time of day still matter.

---

## Changelog (v6.1 — the “Accuracy+” update)

- Cleaner signals by default (more agreement under the hood).
- Simple **Score** so you don’t have to read indicators.
- Four table sizes so it fits any chart layout.

**Made for humans. If you can read green/red arrows, you can use this.**
