# Screener Table (On-chart)

The on-chart Screener shows a compact table of your favorite markets and highlights fresh signals.

---

## Add to a chart

1. Open any chart in TradingView.
2. Add **SP — Screener (Screener Table)**.
3. In **Inputs → Symbols**, paste a comma-separated list (e.g., `BTCUSDT,ETHUSDT,SOLUSDT`).

---

## What the columns mean

- **Pair** — the symbol.
- **Age** — how long since the last signal (close-confirmed).
- **Sig** — top event when applicable (e.g., `EXP`, `TD9`, `OUT`, `LOK/SOK`).
- **Bias** — regime/box color snapshot (green = long-leaning, red = short-leaning).

> Signals are **non-repainting** (finalized at bar close) and use deterministic gating.

---

## Tips

- Keep symbol lists short (10–25) for performance.
- Match
