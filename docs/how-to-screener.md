## How to Read the Grid

The table displays 7 columns for each symbol:

| Column | What It Shows | How to Use It |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **SYMBOL** | Ticker name | Quick identification |
| **SIGNAL** | BUY / SELL / - | Current direction (green/red/gray) |
| **SCORE** | 0-100 quality rating | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Elite (80+), ‚≠ê‚≠ê Premium (60-79), ‚≠ê Standard (40-59) |
| **PRICE** | Current price | Real-time market price |
| **TP1** | First target | Auto-calculated profit target (ATR-based) |
| **AGE** | Bars since signal | 0-5 = fresh, 6-15 = moderate, 16+ = stale |
| **P&L** | Performance since signal | Green = winning, red = losing |

---

## Workflow: Finding Opportunities

### 1. Glance at Grid (10 seconds)
Scan for:
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Elite** (80-100) or ‚≠ê‚≠ê **Premium** (60-79) signals
- **AGE 0-10 bars** (fresh signals)
- **Green P&L** (if signal already triggered, it's working)

### 2. Identify Best Setup (30 seconds)
Example:
```
BTC/USD ‚îÇ BUY ‚îÇ 87 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚îÇ $64,250 ‚îÇ $65,800 ‚îÇ 2 ‚îÇ +0.3%
```
- Elite signal (87)
- Fresh (2 bars old)
- Already showing profit (+0.3%)
- **Action:** Investigate this setup

### 3. Verify on Chart (2 minutes)
Click on the chart to load **BTC/USD** and check:
- [ ] At support level or key zone? (use [Janus Atlas](janus-atlas-v10.md))
- [ ] Volume confirming? (use [Minimal Flow](minimal-flow-v10.md))
- [ ] No major resistance overhead?
- [ ] Aligns with your trading bias?

### 4. Enter Trade (if confirmed)
- Entry: Current price or limit order
- Stop loss: Below recent low (for BUY) or above recent high (for SELL)
- Target: Use TP1 from Grid as first target
- Monitor P&L column to track performance

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake #1: Wrong Ticker Format
**‚ùå Problem:** Symbols show no data or "N/A"

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- Use exact TradingView format: `BINANCE:BTCUSDT` not `BTC` or `BTCUSD`
- Include exchange prefix
- Test ticker on chart first before adding to Grid

---

### Mistake #2: Trading Every Signal
**‚ùå Problem:** Taking too many trades, overtrading

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- Focus on ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Elite and ‚≠ê‚≠ê Premium signals only
- Set Min Score to 60+ in settings
- Always verify on chart before entering

---

### Mistake #3: Chasing Old Signals
**‚ùå Problem:** Entering when AGE > 15 bars

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- Check AGE column
- If >15 bars, signal is likely stale
- Look for fresh signals (0-10 bars) instead

---

### Mistake #4: Ignoring P&L Column
**‚ùå Problem:** Not checking if signal is working

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- If P&L shows -5% and age is high, signal failed ‚Äî skip it
- If P&L is green and signal is fresh, it's confirming ‚Äî good sign
- Use P&L to validate signal quality

---

### Mistake #5: Not Verifying Context
**‚ùå Problem:** Blindly trading Grid signals without chart confirmation

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- Always load the chart
- Check support/resistance levels
- Verify volume and structure
- Grid finds opportunities, YOU confirm quality

## Advanced Tips

### Tip #1: Mix Timeframes
You can set different timeframes for each symbol:
```
Symbol 1-2 (crypto): 1H
Symbol 3-4 (stocks): 4H
Symbol 5-6 (scalp): 15m
Symbol 7-8 (swing): Daily
```
**Why:** Scan multiple horizons simultaneously

---

### Tip #2: Scan Same Ticker, Multiple Timeframes
```
Symbol 1: SPY 15m (scalps)
Symbol 2: SPY 1H (day trades)
Symbol 3: SPY 4H (swings)
```
**Why:** See multi-timeframe confluence for one asset

---

### Tip #3: Use 2 Grid Instances
- **Grid 1:** 8 crypto pairs (1H)
- **Grid 2:** 8 stock tickers (4H)
- **Total:** 16 symbols monitored

**How:** Add Augury Grid twice to same chart

---

### Tip #4: Track Performance by Tier
After 20+ trades, calculate your win rate:
- How many Elite signals won?
- How many Premium signals won?
- Adjust Min Score filter based on YOUR results

---

## Workflow Example (Real Scenario)

**8:00 AM:** Check Grid

Grid shows:
```
AAPL ‚îÇ BUY ‚îÇ 91 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚îÇ $175.20 ‚îÇ $177.80 ‚îÇ 1 ‚îÇ +0.1%
TSLA ‚îÇ SELL ‚îÇ 43 ‚≠ê ‚îÇ $245.90 ‚îÇ $242.10 ‚îÇ 18 ‚îÇ -2.3%
BTC  ‚îÇ BUY ‚îÇ 78 ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚îÇ $64,250 ‚îÇ $65,800 ‚îÇ 5 ‚îÇ +0.8%
```

**Analysis:**
- **AAPL:** Elite signal (91), fresh (1 bar), already working (+0.1%) ‚úÖ
- **TSLA:** Standard signal (43), stale (18 bars), losing (-2.3%) ‚ùå Skip
- **BTC:** Premium signal (78), moderate age (5 bars), working (+0.8%) ‚úÖ

**Action:** Focus on **AAPL** and **BTC**

---

**8:05 AM:** Load AAPL Chart
- At Janus support: ‚úÖ
- Volume spike visible: ‚úÖ
- No resistance overhead: ‚úÖ
- **Decision:** Enter long AAPL at $175.50

---

**8:10 AM:** Load BTC Chart
- Breaking out of consolidation: ‚úÖ
- Higher timeframe aligned: ‚úÖ
- **Decision:** Enter long BTC at $64,300

---

**Throughout day:** Monitor P&L column to track trades

---

**4:00 PM:** Results
- AAPL hit TP1 at $177.80 (+1.3%)

## Why This Matters

### Without Augury Grid:
- Manually flip through 8-20 charts
- Miss signals while looking at other symbols
- No systematic quality scoring
- Hard to track multiple setups

### With Augury Grid:
- See all 8 symbols in one glance (10 seconds)
- Quality scores show you what's worth investigating
- Track performance in real-time
- Focus on your best opportunities

**Bottom line:** Save 30+ minutes per scan, catch more opportunities, trade only the best setups.

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I add more than 8 symbols?**
**A:** Not in one Grid (performance limit). But you can add 2 Grid instances = 16 symbols total.

**Q: What if a symbol shows no data?**
**A:** Check: (1) Ticker format correct? (2) Exchange prefix included? (3) Available on your TradingView plan?

**Q: Should I trade every Elite signal?**
**A:** No. Elite = high quality potential, but still verify context, levels, and your trading plan. No system is 100%.

**Q: Can I get alerts from the Grid?**
**A:** No (table indicators can't create alerts). Workaround: When you see Elite signal, set manual alert on that symbol's chart.

**Q: How often does it update?**
**A:** Every bar close on configured timeframes. If Symbol 1 is set to 15m, it updates every 15 minutes.
