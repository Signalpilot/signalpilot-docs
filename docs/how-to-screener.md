## What Is Augury Grid?

**Augury Grid v1.0** is an on-chart multi-symbol screener table. It monitors 8 tickers simultaneously and displays:

- **Live signals** (BUY/SELL) with quality scores (0-100)
- **Real-time prices** and profit targets
- **Signal age** (how fresh it is)
- **P&L tracking** (how the signal is performing)

**Best for:** Multi-asset traders, portfolio management, finding setups across watchlists

## How to Read the Grid

The table displays 7 columns for each symbol:

| Column | What It Shows | How to Use It |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **SYMBOL** | Ticker name | Quick identification |
| **SIGNAL** | BUY / SELL / - | Current direction (green/red/gray) |
| **SCORE** | 0-100 quality rating | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Elite (80+), ‚≠ê‚≠ê Premium (60-79), ‚≠ê Standard (40-59) |
| **PRICE** | Current price | Real-time market price |
| **TP1** | First target | Auto-calculated profit target (ATR-based) |
| **AGE** | Bars since signal | 0-5 = fresh, 6-15 = moderate, 16+ = stale |
| **P&L** | Performance since signal | Green = winning, red = losing |

---

## Workflow: Finding Opportunities

### 1. Glance at Grid (10 seconds)
Signals can be scanned for:
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **Elite** (80-100) or ‚≠ê‚≠ê **Premium** (60-79) signals
- **AGE 0-10 bars** (fresh signals)
- **Green P&L** (if signal already triggered, it's working)

### 2. Identify Best Setup (30 seconds)
Example:
```
BTC/USD ‚îÇ BUY ‚îÇ 87 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚îÇ $64,250 ‚îÇ $65,800 ‚îÇ 2 ‚îÇ +0.3%
```
- Elite signal (87)
- Fresh (2 bars old)
- Already showing profit (+0.3%)
- **Action:** This setup can be investigated

### 3. Verify on Chart (2 minutes)
The chart can be clicked to load **BTC/USD** and the following can be checked:
- [ ] At support level or key zone? ([Janus Atlas](janus-atlas-v10.md) can be used)
- [ ] Volume confirming? ([Minimal Flow](minimal-flow-v10.md) can be used)
- [ ] No major resistance overhead?
- [ ] Aligns with trading bias?

### 4. Enter Trade (if confirmed)
- Entry: Current price or limit order can be considered
- Stop loss: Below recent low (for BUY) or above recent high (for SELL) can be placed
- Target: TP1 from Grid can be used as first target
- P&L column can be monitored to track performance

## Quality Tiers (Reference Guide)

| Score | Quality | Symbol | Typical Win Rate | Common Approach |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **80-100** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Elite | Multiple factors aligned | ~70-80% | Taken immediately (after verification) |
| **60-79** | ‚≠ê‚≠ê Premium | Strong setup | ~60-70% | Taken with normal risk |
| **40-59** | ‚≠ê Standard | Basic setup | ~50-60% | Selective (only if matches bias) |
| **0-39** | Weak | Poor confluence | <50% | Typically skipped |

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Mistake #1: Wrong Ticker Format
**‚ùå Problem:** Symbols show no data or "N/A"

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- The exact TradingView format is commonly used: `BINANCE:BTCUSDT` not `BTC` or `BTCUSD`
- The exchange prefix is commonly included
- Ticker can be tested on chart first before adding to Grid

---

### Mistake #2: Trading Every Signal
**‚ùå Problem:** Taking too many trades, overtrading

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- Focus can be placed on ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Elite and ‚≠ê‚≠ê Premium signals only
- Min Score can be set to 60+ in settings
- Chart verification commonly occurs before entering

---

### Mistake #3: Chasing Old Signals
**‚ùå Problem:** Entering when AGE > 15 bars

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- AGE column can be checked
- If >15 bars, signal is likely stale
- Fresh signals (0-10 bars) can be looked for instead

---

### Mistake #4: Ignoring P&L Column
**‚ùå Problem:** Not checking if signal is working

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- If P&L shows -5% and age is high, signal failed‚Äîit can be skipped
- If P&L is green and signal is fresh, it's confirming‚Äîgood sign
- P&L can be used to validate signal quality

---

### Mistake #5: Not Verifying Context
**‚ùå Problem:** Blindly trading Grid signals without chart confirmation

**‚úÖ Fix:**
- The chart is typically loaded
- Support/resistance levels are commonly checked
- Volume and structure are commonly verified
- Grid finds opportunities, context confirmation is needed

---

## Advanced Tips

### Tip #1: Mix Timeframes
Different timeframes can be set for each symbol:
```
Symbol 1-2 (crypto): 1H
Symbol 3-4 (stocks): 4H
Symbol 5-6 (scalp): 15m
Symbol 7-8 (swing): Daily
```
**Why:** Multiple horizons can be scanned simultaneously

---

### Tip #2: Scan Same Ticker, Multiple Timeframes
```
Symbol 1: SPY 15m (scalps)
Symbol 2: SPY 1H (day trades)
Symbol 3: SPY 4H (swings)
```
**Why:** Multi-timeframe confluence can be seen for one asset

---

### Tip #3: Use 2 Grid Instances
- **Grid 1:** 8 crypto pairs (1H)
- **Grid 2:** 8 stock tickers (4H)
- **Total:** 16 symbols monitored

**How:** Augury Grid can be added twice to same chart

---

### Tip #4: Track Performance by Tier
After 20+ trades, win rate can be calculated:
- How many Elite signals won?
- How many Premium signals won?
- Min Score filter can be adjusted based on results

---

## Workflow Example (Real Scenario)

**8:00 AM:** Grid can be checked

Grid shows:
```
AAPL ‚îÇ BUY ‚îÇ 91 ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚îÇ $175.20 ‚îÇ $177.80 ‚îÇ 1 ‚îÇ +0.1%
TSLA ‚îÇ SELL ‚îÇ 43 ‚≠ê ‚îÇ $245.90 ‚îÇ $242.10 ‚îÇ 18 ‚îÇ -2.3%
BTC  ‚îÇ BUY ‚îÇ 78 ‚≠ê‚≠ê ‚îÇ $64,250 ‚îÇ $65,800 ‚îÇ 5 ‚îÇ +0.8%
```

**Analysis:**
- **AAPL:** Elite signal (91), fresh (1 bar), already working (+0.1%) ‚úÖ
- **TSLA:** Standard signal (43), stale (18 bars), losing (-2.3%) ‚ùå Can be skipped
- **BTC:** Premium signal (78), moderate age (5 bars), working (+0.8%) ‚úÖ

**Action:** Focus can be placed on **AAPL** and **BTC**

---

**8:05 AM:** AAPL Chart can be loaded
- At Janus support: ‚úÖ
- Volume spike visible: ‚úÖ
- No resistance overhead: ‚úÖ
- **Decision:** Long AAPL consideration at $175.50

---

**8:10 AM:** BTC Chart can be loaded
- Breaking out of consolidation: ‚úÖ
- Higher timeframe aligned: ‚úÖ
- **Decision:** Long BTC consideration at $64,300

---

**Throughout day:** P&L column can be monitored to track trades

---

**4:00 PM:** Results
- AAPL hit TP1 at $177.80 (+1.3%)
- BTC still running, stop moved to breakeven

---

## Why This Matters

### Without Augury Grid:
- Manual flipping through 8-20 charts is required
- Signals can be missed while looking at other symbols
- No systematic quality scoring available
- Multiple setups are hard to track

### With Augury Grid:
- All 8 symbols can be seen in one glance (10 seconds)
- Quality scores show what's worth investigating
- Performance can be tracked in real-time
- Focus can be placed on best opportunities

**Bottom line:** 30+ minutes per scan can be saved, more opportunities can be caught, only the best setups are traded.

---

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I add more than 8 symbols?**
**A:** Not in one Grid (performance limit). But 2 Grid instances can be added = 16 symbols total.

**Q: What if a symbol shows no data?**
**A:** The following can be checked: (1) Ticker format correct? (2) Exchange prefix included? (3) Available on TradingView plan?

**Q: Should I trade every Elite signal?**
**A:** No. Elite = high quality potential, but context, levels, and trading plan can be verified. No system is 100%.

**Q: Can I get alerts from the Grid?**
**A:** No (table indicators can't create alerts). Workaround: When Elite signal is seen, manual alert can be set on that symbol's chart.

**Q: How often does it update?**
**A:** Every bar close on configured timeframes. If Symbol 1 is set to 15m, it updates every 15 minutes.
