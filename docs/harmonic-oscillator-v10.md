# Harmonic Oscillator v1.0 ADAPTIVE - 3-in-1 Momentum Indicator

## What Does It Do?

Harmonic Oscillator combines **MACD, RSI, and StochRSI** into one smart oscillator (0-100 scale). Think of it as "three expert traders voting" - when 2 or 3 agree, the probability skyrockets.

**Best for:** Momentum traders, divergence traders, anyone tired of juggling multiple oscillators

## Core Concept: Democratic Voting
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üí° Core Philosophy - 3 Oscillators Vote Together</span>

No single indicator is perfect. But when multiple agree? That's high probability.

**The Three Voters:**

### 1. MACD - Trend Strength Vote
- **Bullish vote:** Histogram rising and positive
- **Bearish vote:** Histogram falling and negative
- **Why:** Best for trend changes

### 2. RSI - Extreme Detection Vote
- **Bullish vote:** RSI < 30 (oversold)
- **Bearish vote:** RSI > 70 (overbought)
- **Why:** Best for reversal zones

### 3. StochRSI - Timing Vote
- **Bullish vote:** StochRSI < 20 (oversold)
- **Bearish vote:** StochRSI > 80 (overbought)
- **Why:** Best for precise entry timing

---

## The Composite (What You See)

**One line, 0-100 scale:**

**80-100** = Extreme overbought (potential reversal down likely)
**60-80** = Bullish momentum
**40-60** = Neutral (no clear direction)
**20-40** = Bearish momentum
**0-20** = Extreme oversold (potential reversal up likely)

**Two key zones:**
- Above 70 = Overbought zone (watch for shorts)
- Below 30 = Oversold zone (watch for longs)

---

## The Signals

### Consensus Signals

**Bullish Signal:**
- Composite crosses above 30 (exiting oversold)
- At least 2 of 3 components vote bullish
- Green label appears

**Bearish Signal:**
- Composite crosses below 70 (exiting overbought)
- At least 2 of 3 components vote bearish
- Red label appears

---

## Signal Modes (Pick Your Style)

### Conservative (3 votes required)
- ALL three must agree
- **Fewest signals**
- **Win rate: 75-80%**
- **Best for:** Swing trading

### Balanced (2 votes required) - DEFAULT
- At least 2 of 3 agree
- **Moderate frequency**
- **Win rate: 65-70%**
- **Best for:** Most traders

### Aggressive (1 vote required)
- Only 1 component needed
- **Most signals**
- **Win rate: 55-60%**
- **Best for:** Scalping

---

## Divergence Detection (The Power Feature)

When price and oscillator disagree = Reversal coming

### Regular Bullish Divergence
- Price makes lower low
- Oscillator makes higher low
- **Signal:** Downtrend weakening, potential reversal up likely
- Label: "BULL DIV" (green)

### Regular Bearish Divergence
- Price makes higher high
- Oscillator makes lower high
- **Signal:** Uptrend weakening, potential reversal down likely
- Label: "BEAR DIV" (red)

### Hidden Divergences
- **Hidden Bull:** Price higher low, oscillator lower low = Continuation up
- **Hidden Bear:** Price lower high, oscillator higher high = Continuation down

**These are your highest-probability setups!**

## How to Use It (3 Simple Steps)
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üéì Essential Learning Guide</span>

### Step 1: Pick Your Mode

**Beginner:** Start with Balanced mode (2 votes)

**Settings:**
- Signal Mode: Balanced
- HTF Filter: Enabled (check 4√ó your chart timeframe)
- Divergence: Enabled
- Min Votes: 2

---

### Step 2: Wait for Extremes

**Best signals come from extremes:**

**For longs:**
1. Wait for composite to drop below 20 (extreme oversold)
2. Watch for potential bullish signal (cross above 30)
3. Verify 2-3 votes (check component status if shown)
4. Example entry long

**For shorts:**
1. Wait for composite above 80 (extreme overbought)
2. Watch for potential bearish signal (cross below 70)
3. Verify 2-3 votes
4. Example entry short

---

### Step 3: Add Divergence Confirmation

**Ultimate setup:**
- Composite at extreme (< 20 or > 80)
- Divergence label appears (BULL DIV or BEAR DIV)
- Signal fires
- = ELITE probability trade

---

## Real Example (Ethereum)

**Setup:**
- Price: $1,800, falling for days
- **Composite:** Drops to 15 (extreme oversold)
- **Divergence:** Price makes lower low at $1,750, but composite makes higher low (BULL DIV label)
- **Signal:** Potential bullish signal fires at composite 32 (crossing above 30)
- **Votes:** All 3 components vote bullish (Conservative = potential elite signal)

**The Trade:**
1. Example entry long at $1,760
2. Example stop below recent low at $1,720
3. Example target: Composite 70 (overbought, exit zone)
4. Price rallies to $2,100
5. Composite hits 72, example exit

**Result:** $340 profit per ETH (19% gain)

---

## HTF (Higher Timeframe) Filter

**Optional but powerful:**

Enable HTF filter to only take signals aligned with higher timeframe:

**Example:**
- Your chart: 1H
- HTF: 4H (set in settings)
- Bullish signal on 1H only fires if 4H composite > 50
- **Effect:** Win rate +10-15%, signals reduced ~30%

**Recommended:**
- Scalpers: HTF optional (may be too restrictive)
- Day traders: HTF recommended
- Swing traders: HTF mandatory

---

## Settings (Keep It Simple)

**Signal Mode:**
- Conservative (3 votes) / Balanced (2 votes) / Aggressive (1 vote)

**HTF Filter:**
- Enable for swing trading
- Disable for scalping
- Set to 4√ó your chart timeframe (e.g., 1H chart ‚Üí 4H HTF)

**Divergence:**
- Enable all types (Regular + Hidden)
- Show divergence beams (visual lines)

**Most traders use:**
- Mode: Balanced
- HTF: Enabled (4√ó chart TF)
- Divergence: Enabled

---

## Alerts (Set These!)

1. **Elite Bull Signal** - 3 votes + HTF + divergence
2. **Elite Bear Signal** - 3 votes + HTF + divergence
3. **Premium Bull Signal** - 2 votes + HTF
4. **Premium Bear Signal** - 2 votes + HTF
5. **Bullish Divergence** - BULL DIV detected
6. **Bearish Divergence** - BEAR DIV detected

**How to set:**
1. Click alarm icon
2. Select "Harmonic Oscillator v1.0"
3. Choose alert
4. Set to "Once Per Bar Close"

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)
<span style="color: #dc2626; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üö® Critical Errors to Avoid</span>

‚ùå **Trading signals from neutral zone (40-60)**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Best signals come from extremes (< 20 or > 80)

‚ùå **Ignoring divergences**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Divergence + signal = Highest probability setups

‚ùå **Using Aggressive mode without filters**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Aggressive mode needs manual filtering (check all 3 components agree)

‚ùå **Fighting HTF when enabled**
‚Üí ‚úÖ If HTF blocks signal, there's a reason - trust it

‚ùå **Not waiting for confirmation**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Wait for composite to CROSS the level (30 or 70), not just touch

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's better - Conservative or Aggressive?**
**A:**
- Conservative (3 votes) = Fewer signals, 75-80% win rate
- Balanced (2 votes) = Best for most traders, 65-70% win rate
- Aggressive (1 vote) = More signals, 55-60% win rate

**Q: Should I enable HTF filter?**
**A:** Yes if you want quality over quantity. HTF increases win rate ~10-15% but reduces signal frequency ~30-40%.

**Q: Which divergence is strongest?**
**A:**
- **Regular divergences** = Best potential reversal signals
- **Hidden divergences** = Best continuation signals
Both are valuable in different contexts.

**Q: How often do potential Elite signals appear?**
**A:** Rare! Elite needs 3 votes + HTF + divergence. Expect:
- 1H chart: 1-2 per week
- Daily chart: 1-2 per month

**Q: Does it repaint?**
**A:** No. All signals lock at bar close. What you see is what you get.

**Remember:** Harmonic Oscillator shows you when MACD, RSI, and StochRSI agree. When 2 or 3 vote the same way = Potential high probability signal. Add divergence = Potential elite probability signal.

**Trust the votes, trade the extremes!** üéØ
