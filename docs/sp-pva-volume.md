# SP ‚Äî Participation & Volume Pulse (SP-PVA Suite) ‚Äî by Signal Pilot
**Modules:**  
- **Participation (PVA Overlay)** ‚Äî on-chart signals

Built to show when real money is moving.  
Clean, color-coded, and **non-repainting** ‚Äî signals only lock at candle close.

## üß≠ What These Do

### üü¢ Participation (PVA Overlay)
Think of it as a **crowd-meter on your price chart.**  
It prints one clear nudge:
- **BULL** ‚Üí buyers are in control  
- **BEAR** ‚Üí sellers are in control  
Plus two special spike tags:
- **CLX (Climax):** a heavy surge ‚Äî often the last big push  
- **ABS (Absorption):** price hit resistance/support and got soaked up

Each print means something actually happened in volume and pressure ‚Äî not just noise.

---

### üîµ Volume Pulse (PVA Volume)
Goes in a **separate pane under your chart.**  
Shows:
- **Colored volume bars** ‚Äî green/red = intensity of participation  
- **Blue CVD line** ‚Äî who‚Äôs winning (buyers vs sellers)  
- **Divergence tags** ‚Äî ‚ÄúBull Div‚Äù or ‚ÄúBear Div‚Äù = early heads-up for a possible pause or reversal  
- **CLX / ABS spikes** ‚Äî same logic as the overlay, shown near key daily/weekly levels  

It‚Äôs the ‚Äúheartbeat‚Äù behind the on-chart signals.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (60-Second Setup)

1. Add **Participation (PVA Overlay)** to your main chart.  
2. Add **Volume Pulse (PVA Volume)** to a new lower pane.  
3. Leave defaults. They‚Äôre already tuned.  
4. Trade flow:
   - Wait for a **BULL** or **BEAR** print (overlay).  
   - Check for **CLX/ABS** spikes (Overlay or Volume Pulse).  
   - Use your normal strategy or structure levels to confirm entries/exits.

**No repainting:** Every signal locks after the candle closes.

## üß© How to Read the Signals

| Signal | Meaning | Tip |
|:--|:--|:--|
| **BULL** | Buyers took control | Stay with longs until a BEAR or CLX/ABS shows |
| **BEAR** | Sellers took control | Stay with shorts until a BULL or CLX/ABS shows |
| **CLX** | ‚ÄúClimax‚Äù ‚Äî huge burst | Often the end of a push or start of fast continuation |
| **ABS** | ‚ÄúAbsorption‚Äù ‚Äî move soaked up | Often exhaustion or turning area |
| **Bull Div / Bear Div** | Volume & price disagree | Watch for early reversals |

> One event per bar ‚Äî if there‚Äôs a spike (CLX/ABS), you won‚Äôt see a BULL/BEAR on that same candle. Clean chart, clear story.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Best Starter Settings

You don‚Äôt need to tweak much:
- **Use HTF confirm:** OFF (default) ‚Üí ON for stricter, fewer signals  
- **Enable EVR (CLX/ABS):** ON (default)  
- **Limit to Session:** OFF (default) ‚Üí ON for stocks (09:30‚Äì16:00)  

**Best timeframes:** 15m, 30m, 1h (clean and balanced)  
**For faster scalping:** 1‚Äì5m (noisier, consider HTF confirm ON)  
**For swing:** 4h‚Äì1D (quieter, but strong context)

---

## üß† Simple Game Plan

1. **See a BULL print?** Favor long bias.  
2. **See a BEAR print?** Favor short bias.  
3. **See CLX or ABS?** Wait ‚Äî the crowd just shouted. Let the next candle confirm.  
4. **See Divergence in Volume Pulse?** Momentum may be shifting; watch closely.

Pair it with your normal support/resistance or structure tools.

## üîî Built-in Alerts (close-confirmed)

| Alert Name | When it Fires |
|:--|:--|
| **SP:Participation BULL** | Buyers dominate participation |
| **SP:Participation BEAR** | Sellers dominate participation |
| **SP:Participation CLX** | Climax spike |
| **SP:Participation ABS** | Absorption spike |

They only trigger **after** the candle closes ‚Äî zero repaint risk.
