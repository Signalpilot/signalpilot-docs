# SP — Reversal Candlestick Structure (SP:RCS) ✨📈 — by Signal Pilot

A friendly TradingView helper that **marks well‑known candlestick reversal patterns** right on your chart.  
Labels appear **only after the candle closes** (so they don’t disappear later). To keep charts clean, the tool shows **at most one bullish and one bearish label per bar**.

---

## ✨ What you’ll see

- 🏷️ Short **labels under/over candles** like `BuE`, `BE`, `MS`, `ES`.  
- 🟩 **Teal/green = bullish idea**, 🟥 **red = bearish idea**.  
- ↕️ Labels sit a little away from price so they’re easy to read.

> 🔎 Treat every label as a **heads‑up**, not a must‑trade. Always use your own confirmation and risk rules.

1. 🧭 Open **TradingView → Pine Editor**.  
2. 📋 Paste the script → 💾 **Save** → ➕ **Add to chart**.

## 🕹️ Use it in practice

1. ⏱️ **Wait for a label** at candle **close**.  
2. ⬇️ A **bullish label below** a candle hints at a possible bounce.  
3. ⬆️ A **bearish label above** a candle hints at a possible turn down.  
4. 🧰 Add your own tools (support/resistance, trendlines, volume) before acting.

## 🔧 The only 3 settings most people need

You’ll find these in the **Reversal Logic** panel.

- 🎚️ **Threshold** — *How picky it is*  
  Higher = fewer, stronger labels. Start at **80**.  
  - Want **fewer** labels? Try **85–90**.  
  - Want **more** labels? Try **70–75**.

- 🧊 **Same‑side Cooldown** — *Spacing between similar signals*  
  Minimum bars between two bullish (or two bearish) labels. Start at **20**.  
  Raise it to reduce clutter.

- 🔄 **FlipGuard Decay** — *Brake after a flip*  
  Bars to wait before allowing a new **opposite‑side** label. Start at **5**.  
  Increase if you see whipsaws.

> ✳️ That’s it. Everything else is optional style or per‑pattern toggles.

---

## 🎨 Make it look how you like

- 🔤 Change **text size**, 🎨 **colors**, and 🧱 **background** in **Style**.  
- ↔️ “Offset” keeps labels comfortably away from candles. The default works for most charts.

---

## ⏰ Alerts (so you don’t miss anything)

1. ⏰ Click the **alarm clock** → **Create Alert…**  
2. 🧩 **Condition:** pick a specific pattern, e.g. **“SP:RCS | BE”** for Bearish Engulfing.  
3. 📣 Choose your preferred delivery (app, email, webhook).  
4. 💾 Save.

Create multiple alerts—one per pattern you care about.

## 🧪 Starter presets (pick one row and go)

| Timeframe | Threshold | Cooldown | FlipGuard |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 5–15m | 85–90 | 30–50 | 8–12 |
| 30–60m | 80–85 | 20–30 | 6–10 |
| 4H–1D | 75–80 | 10–20 | 5–8 |

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- 🧹 **Too many labels?** Raise **Threshold**, raise **Cooldown**, or turn off lower‑priority patterns (Harami, Tweezers).  
- 🔍 **Too few labels?** Lower **Threshold** a bit (‑5 to ‑10) and/or reduce **Cooldown**.  
- 🧱 **Labels on top of price?** Increase label **Offset** or pick a larger **Text Size**.  
- 🔒 **Do labels repaint?** No. Labels appear **after candle close** and stay.

## ❓ FAQ

**Do I need all patterns on?**  
🙅 No. Many traders begin with **Engulfing** and **Morning/Evening Star**, then add more.

**Which markets/timeframes work?**  
🌍 Anything with candles. Intraday usually needs stricter settings; higher timeframes can be looser.

**Why didn’t a label print when I expected one?**  
🧪 It likely didn’t meet the shape rules or your **Threshold/Cooldown/FlipGuard** filtered it.  
Try lowering the Threshold slightly to test.
