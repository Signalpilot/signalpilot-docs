**‚úÖ Action:** Assess your knowledge, fill gaps if needed

---

### 4. Trading Platform/Broker (If Trading Live)

**For paper trading:** Just TradingView is fine

**For live trading:** You need a broker

**Compatible brokers:**
- Any broker that supports your markets
- Crypto: Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.
- Forex: OANDA, FXCM, Interactive Brokers
- Stocks: TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers, Fidelity
- Some brokers integrate with TradingView

**TradingView broker integration:**
- Some brokers allow trading directly from TradingView
- Check [TradingView Brokers page](https://www.tradingview.com/brokers/)

**‚úÖ Action:** Have broker account ready (if trading live)

---

### 5. Trading Capital (If Trading Live)

**Recommended minimum capital:**

**Paper trading:** $0 (virtual money)

**Live trading minimums:**
- **Crypto:** $500-$1,000 minimum
- **Forex:** $500-$1,000 minimum
- **Stocks:** $2,000-$5,000 minimum (depends on broker/regulations)

**Why these minimums:**
- Proper position sizing with 1-2% risk per trade
- Example: $500 account √ó 1% = $5 risk per trade
- Below these amounts, position sizing becomes difficult

**IMPORTANT:**
- Only trade with money you can afford to lose
- Start with paper trading first
- Transition to live only after consistent paper profits
- Never trade with rent money, savings, or borrowed funds

**‚úÖ Action:** Ensure you have appropriate capital (or start with paper trading)
