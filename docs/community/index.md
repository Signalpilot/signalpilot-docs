2. Watch: Price approaches cluster zone
3. Confirm: Pentarch signal appears AT cluster
4. Validate: Volume Oracle confirms with spike

**Divergence Workflow**
1. Scan: Plutus Flow for price-OBV divergence
2. Confirm: Pentarch cycle shift signal (BDN→TD or CAP→BDN)

### Common Beginner Mistakes (Community Lessons)

**❌ Mistake #1:** Using too many indicators at once
**✅ Solution:** Start with 2-3, add gradually

**❌ Mistake #2:** Trading every signal
**✅ Solution:** Wait for confluence (multiple confirmations)

**❌ Mistake #3:** Skipping paper trading
**✅ Solution:** Practice 2-4 weeks before risking capital

**❌ Mistake #4:** Enabling all 39 Janus levels
**✅ Solution:** Start with 5 core levels

**❌ Mistake #5:** Expecting 100% win rate
**✅ Solution:** Focus on high-probability setups, accept losses are normal
