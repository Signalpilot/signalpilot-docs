---

## System 1: TD Sequential

### What It Does
DeMark's famous exhaustion indicator - counts consecutive bars moving in one direction. When you hit "9", the move is likely exhausted.

### The Signals

**TD Buy Countdown** (Green numbers 1-9 below bars)
- Counts consecutive closes BELOW previous bar's close
- When you see **9** in green = oversold exhaustion, potential bottom
- Classic reversal zone

**TD Sell Countdown** (Red numbers 1-9 above bars)
- Counts consecutive closes ABOVE previous bar's close
- When you see **9** in red = overbought exhaustion, potential top
- Classic reversal zone

### Key Details (Omnideck Implementation)
- **Fully anchored** - sequences don't reset incorrectly
- **Buy/Sell independent** - can have both active simultaneously on volatile swings
- Numbers appear only on chart (no clutter until the sequence forms)

### How to Trade It
- **Conservative:** Wait for 9, then look for confirmation (reversal candle, volume spike)
- **Aggressive:** Enter on 8, anticipating 9 completion
- **Filter:** Combine with Regime Box (don't fight strong regimes)

**Example:**
```
Price falling: 1 → 2 → 3 → ... → 8 → 9 (green)
→ Look for long entry, likely bottom forming
```

---

## System 2: Squeeze Detector

### What It Does
Identifies compression (volatility contraction) and expansion (breakout) phases using Bollinger Bands inside Keltner Channels.

### The Signals

**Squeeze States:**
- **Red dots on price** = Squeeze ACTIVE (Bollinger Bands inside Keltner Channels)
  - Volatility is compressed
  - Big move coming soon
  - Don't trade breakouts yet (wait for release)

- **Green arrows** = Squeeze BREAK (expansion begins)
  - **↑ Green arrow** = Bullish breakout
  - **↓ Red/Dark arrow** = Bearish breakdown
  - High probability directional move starting

### How to Trade It
1. **Wait for red dots** to appear (squeeze forming)
2. **Let them cluster** (3-5+ bars in squeeze = better)
3. **Watch for arrow** = direction confirmed
4. **Enter on arrow** with tight stop below/above squeeze range
5. **Target:** Extended move (often 2-3x squeeze range)

**Why It Works:**
Volatility contracts → energy builds → explosive release. You're catching the explosion right as it starts.

---

## System 3: Liquidity Sweeps

### What It Does
Detects "stop hunts" where price spikes to grab liquidity (stop losses) then immediately reverses.

### The Signals

**LL Tag** (Lower Low sweep)
- Price makes new low
- Immediately reverses back above previous low
- Classic stop hunt below support
- **Bullish signal** (fake breakdown)

**HH Tag** (Higher High sweep)
- Price makes new high
- Immediately reverses back below previous high
- Classic stop hunt above resistance
- **Bearish signal** (fake breakout)

### How to Trade It
These are **reversal setups**, not continuation:

**LL Sweep (Bullish):**
1. Price drops below previous low (LL tag appears)
2. Enters long immediately or on next bar
3. Stop below the sweep low
4. Target: Return to range or previous resistance

**HH Sweep (Bearish):**
1. Price spikes above previous high (HH tag appears)
2. Enter short immediately or on next bar
3. Stop above the sweep high
4. Target: Return to range or previous support

**Pro Tip:** Combine with TD Sequential. "TD 9 + Liquidity Sweep" = ultra high-probability reversal.

---

## System 4: EMA Trio (50/100/200)

### What It Does
The three most-watched moving averages by institutions, with 8 automatic event detection types.

### The Three EMAs

**EMA 50** (Fast, light blue) - Short-term trend
**EMA 100** (Medium, blue) - Intermediate trend
**EMA 200** (Slow, dark blue) - Long-term trend, "the line in the sand"

### The 8 Event Types

**PB (Pullback)** - Price touches EMA then bounces
- Green label = Bullish pullback to EMA (buy the dip)
- Red label = Bearish pullback to EMA (sell the rip)
- Requires price to be trending in that direction

**RC (Retest Confirm)** - Price retests broken EMA
- Price breaks above EMA
- Pulls back to retest it as support
- Bounces = RC label
- Classic entry after breakout

**RJ (Rejection)** - Price rejected at EMA
- Price tries to cross EMA
- Gets rejected (wick through, close back)
- Shows EMA acting as strong resistance/support
- Visual styling (not label, to save label budget)

**GC (Golden Cross)** - Bullish EMA cross
- Fast EMA crosses above Slow EMA
- Major bullish signal
- 50/100 GC or 50/200 GC both tracked

**DC (Death Cross)** - Bearish EMA cross
- Fast EMA crosses below Slow EMA
- Major bearish signal
- 50/100 DC or 50/200 DC both tracked

**EMA Convergence** - All three EMAs cluster tightly
- Trend transition zone
- Prepare for breakout in either direction

**EMA Divergence** - EMAs spread far apart
- Strong trending phase
- Don't fade the trend

**Triple Stack**
- All three EMAs aligned (50 > 100 > 200 or reversed)
- Strongest trend signal
- Only trade with the stack direction

### How to Trade It

**Trend Following:**
```
Triple Stack (50>100>200) + PB to EMA 50 = Buy
→ Continuation entry in strong uptrend
```

**Breakout Trading:**
```
Price breaks above EMA 200 (GC) → wait for RC (retest) → Enter long
→ Confirmed breakout with retest
```

**Reversal Trading:**
```
Price approaching EMA 200 + RJ (rejection) = Strong resistance
→ Short entry if bearish context
```

---

## System 5: SuperTrend Consensus

### What It Does
Runs multiple SuperTrend calculations (different ATR multipliers) and only shows signal when majority agree.

### The Signals

**Green Background Ribbon** = Bullish SuperTrend consensus (2 of 3 agree)
**Red Background Ribbon** = Bearish SuperTrend consensus (2 of 3 agree)

### The Components (Behind the Scenes)
- SuperTrend 1.0x ATR (sensitive)
- SuperTrend 2.0x ATR (balanced)
- SuperTrend 3.0x ATR (conservative)

**Consensus requires 2 of 3** = reduces whipsaws significantly vs single SuperTrend

### How to Trade It
- **Green ribbon** = Only look for longs
- **Red ribbon** = Only look for shorts
- **Flip from red to green** = Major trend reversal (powerful signal)
- **No ribbon** = Choppy, wait for clarity

**Combine with:**
- EMA Trio: SuperTrend green + Triple Stack bullish = ultra strong trend
- Regime Box: Both green = highest probability longs

---

## System 6: BMSB (Bull Market Support Band)

### What It Does
Identifies the "support band" in bull markets - the zone where healthy pullbacks should hold.

### The Components

**20 SMA** (Simple Moving Average)
**21 EMA** (Exponential Moving Average)

These create a "band" of support. In bull markets:
- Price should stay above the band
- Pullbacks to the band = buy opportunities
- Break below band = warning signal

### The Fix in v1.7.0 🔧
**Previous versions:** Plotted average of 20 SMA + 21 EMA (single line)
**v1.7.0:** Plots BOTH lines separately
- Now you can see the full band width
- Better visibility of support zone strength

### How to Trade It

**In Bull Market:**
1. Price pulls back to BMSB (touches 20 SMA or 21 EMA)
2. Holds above or wicks through slightly
3. Enter long on bounce
4. Stop below the band

**Warning Signal:**
- Price closes BELOW the band = trend weakening
- Don't buy dips until price reclaims band

**In Bear Market:**
- BMSB acts as resistance (inverse logic)
- Rallies that fail at the band = short opportunities

---

## System 7: Regime Box

### What It Does
Background coloring that shows the current market regime using 4-factor voting.

### The 4 Votes

1. **EMA Alignment** - Are EMAs stacked bullish/bearish?
2. **Price Position** - Is price above/below key EMAs?
3. **Momentum** - Is momentum trending up/down?
4. **Divergences** - Are there hidden warnings?

**Majority wins** (3+ votes) = Regime declared

### The Colors

**Green background** = Bullish regime (majority vote)
- Look for long setups
- Avoid shorts unless very strong reversal signals

**Red background** = Bearish regime (majority vote)
- Look for short setups
- Avoid longs unless very strong reversal signals

**Gray/Neutral** = No clear regime
- Choppy, ranging, transitioning
- Reduce position size or stay flat

### The v1.7.0 Guarantee: ZERO Gaps! 🎯

**Previous versions:** Occasionally had 1-bar gaps in coloring (visual glitch)
**v1.7.0:** Bulletproof algorithm ensures every single bar has regime color
- No more missing bars
- Smooth, continuous background
- Perfect for visual bias at a glance

### How to Use It
This is your **bias filter**:
- Green regime + bullish setup = TAKE IT
- Green regime + bearish setup = SKIP (low probability)
- Red regime + bearish setup = TAKE IT
- Red regime + bullish setup = SKIP (low probability)

**Massively improves win rate** by keeping you on the right side of the trend.

---

## System 8: Supply/Demand Zones

### What It Does
Automatically detects institutional supply (resistance) and demand (support) zones based on price rejection and volume.

### Zone Types

**Demand Zones** (Green boxes below price)
- Areas where institutions accumulated (buying)
- Price should bounce when returning here
- Support zones

**Supply Zones** (Red boxes above price)
- Areas where institutions distributed (selling)
- Price should reject when returning here
- Resistance zones

### Zone Features

**Merge Algorithm**
- Overlapping zones automatically merge into single zone
- Prevents clutter

**Exclusive Mode**
- Zones that have been tested and broken get removed
- Keeps chart clean (only active zones remain)

**Quality Badges** ⭐
- ⭐ = Standard zone
- ⭐⭐ = High quality (strong volume, clean rejection)
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Elite zone (institutional level, untested)

### Zone Settings

**Lookback:** How many bars to scan (default: 200)
**Strength Threshold:** Minimum rejection strength to create zone
**Merge Distance:** How close zones must be to merge

### How to Trade Zones

**Demand Zone (Support):**
1. Price approaches green demand zone
2. Wait for bullish reaction (reversal candle, volume spike)
3. Enter long
4. Stop below zone
5. Target: Next supply zone above

**Supply Zone (Resistance):**
1. Price approaches red supply zone
2. Wait for bearish reaction (reversal candle, rejection)
3. Enter short
4. Stop above zone
5. Target: Next demand zone below

**Pro Tip:** Elite zones (⭐⭐⭐) have highest probability. First test of fresh zone = best setup.

---

## System 9: Reversal Candlestick Patterns

### What It Does
Automatically detects 16 classic Japanese candlestick reversal patterns.

### The 16 Patterns (All Have Individual Toggles!)

**Bullish Reversals:**
1. **Hammer** - Long lower wick, small body, rejection of lows
2. **Inverted Hammer** - Long upper wick at bottom (tests resistance)
3. **Bullish Engulfing** - Large green candle engulfs previous red
4. **Piercing Line** - Green candle closes above midpoint of previous red
5. **Morning Star** - Three-candle bottom reversal
6. **Three White Soldiers** - Three consecutive strong green candles
7. **Bullish Harami** - Small green inside large red (indecision)
8. **Tweezer Bottom** - Two candles, identical lows

**Bearish Reversals:**
9. **Shooting Star** - Long upper wick, small body, rejection of highs
10. **Hanging Man** - Like hammer but at top (bearish)
11. **Bearish Engulfing** - Large red candle engulfs previous green
12. **Dark Cloud Cover** - Red candle closes below midpoint of previous green
13. **Evening Star** - Three-candle top reversal
14. **Three Black Crows** - Three consecutive strong red candles
15. **Bearish Harami** - Small red inside large green (indecision)
16. **Tweezer Top** - Two candles, identical highs

### Pattern Display

- Labels appear on the pattern candle
- Each pattern has unique identifier (e.g., "HAM" for Hammer, "BE" for Bullish Engulfing)
- **Zoom-aware:** Only shows patterns within last 400 bars (prevents old chart clutter)

### How to Trade Patterns

**Never trade patterns alone!** Combine with:

**Pattern + Zone:**
```
Hammer at Demand Zone = Very high probability long
```

**Pattern + TD Sequential:**
```
Bullish Engulfing + TD 9 = Major bottom signal
```

**Pattern + Regime:**
```
Bullish pattern in Green Regime = High probability
Bullish pattern in Red Regime = Skip (low probability)
```

**Pattern + Liquidity Sweep:**
```
LL Sweep + Hammer = Ultimate reversal setup
```

## System 10: Meta Tools

Additional confluence features that tie everything together:

- **Signal Clustering** - When multiple systems align on same bar
- **Divergence Warnings** - Price/indicator divergences (integrated with Regime)
- **Timeframe Sync** - All systems use consistent calculation periods
- **Performance Mode** - Optimized rendering for long-term charts

---

## SP Protocol Compliance

### 🔒 Repaint Audit (v1.7.0)

**Security Calls:**
All HTF requests (BMSB optional HTF mode) use `lookahead_off`:
```
Line ~134: request.security(syminfo.tickerid, htf_timeframe, ta.sma(close, 20),
                            lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)
Line ~135: request.security(syminfo.tickerid, htf_timeframe, ta.ema(close, 21),
                            lookahead=barmerge.lookahead_off)
// ... (similar for other HTF calls)
```

**Alert Conditions:**
All 15+ alerts gated by `barstate.isconfirmed`:
```
Line ~1247: alertcondition(tdBuy9 and barstate.isconfirmed, "TD Buy 9", ...)
Line ~1250: alertcondition(tdSell9 and barstate.isconfirmed, "TD Sell 9", ...)
Line ~1253: alertcondition(squeezeBreakBull and barstate.isconfirmed, "Squeeze Break Up", ...)
Line ~1256: alertcondition(stFlipBull and barstate.isconfirmed, "SuperTrend Bullish", ...)
Line ~1289: alertcondition(llSweep and barstate.isconfirmed, "LL Sweep", ...)
Line ~1292: alertcondition(hhSweep and barstate.isconfirmed, "HH Sweep", ...)
Line ~1301: alertcondition(goldenCross and barstate.isconfirmed, "Golden Cross", ...)
// ... (all alerts similarly gated)
```

**Label/Shape Creation:**
All visual elements anchored to confirmed bars:
```
Line ~678: if tdBuyCount == 9 and barstate.isconfirmed
Line ~681:     label.new(bar_index, low, "9", ...)

Line ~734: if squeezeActive and barstate.isconfirmed
Line ~735:     plotshape(squeezeActive, style=shape.circle, ...)

Line ~812: if llSweep and barstate.isconfirmed
Line ~813:     label.new(bar_index, low, "LL", ...)

// All systems follow this pattern
```

**Verdict:** ✅ **ZERO repaint vectors detected**

Every system uses confirmed bar logic. TD sequences anchor properly. Patterns require complete candle. Zones lock in after bar close. All alerts wait for confirmation.

---

### 📋 Behavioral Contract

**On Unconfirmed Bars:**
- TD counts update (but labels don't appear until bar close)
- Squeeze state calculates (dots wait for confirmation)
- EMA calculations update in real-time
- Zone boundaries may shift slightly as bar develops
- Candlestick patterns evaluate but don't label until close

**On Bar Close:**
- All labels/shapes lock in permanently
- TD sequence numbers finalize
- Patterns confirm and label
- Zones finalize boundaries
- Alerts fire
- All historical values become unchangeable

**HTF Data (BMSB):**
- Optional HTF mode uses `lookahead_off` → may lag 1 bar for determinism
- Default mode uses chart timeframe (no lag)
- Tradeoff: Lag vs repaint - we choose lag

**Regime Box Gaps:**
- v1.7.0 GUARANTEES zero gaps (every bar colored)
- Uses forward-fill logic when vote is tied
- Previous bar color extends if no clear majority

---

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Label Budget (500 Maximum)**
   - TradingView limits labels per script
   - Omnideck optimizes distribution across systems
   - If all 10 systems enabled + long chart, oldest labels may delete
   - Solution: Disable systems you're not actively using
   - RC/RJ events use visual styling (not labels) to conserve budget

2. **Zoom-Aware = Historical Loss**
   - SD Zones only show last 200 bars
   - Patterns only show last 400 bars
   - This is INTENTIONAL (prevents performance issues)
   - Tradeoff: Can't see very old zones/patterns
   - Benefit: Indicator runs smoothly even on years of data

3. **TD Sequential Resets**
   - Sequences reset when direction changes (this is DeMark's design)
   - Rapid reversals may create incomplete sequences
   - This is expected behavior, not a bug
   - More common on lower timeframes (1m, 5m)

4. **Pattern False Positives**
   - Candlestick patterns work best at key levels
   - Patterns in "no man's land" have lower success rate
   - ALWAYS combine with context (Regime, Zones, etc.)
   - User responsibility to filter by quality

5. **Multiple Systems = Visual Complexity**
   - Enabling all 10 systems creates busy chart
   - Not recommended for beginners
   - Start with 3-4 systems, add gradually
   - Use individual toggles to clean up

6. **BMSB Plotting (v1.7.0 Fixed)**
   - Prior versions showed average line (single plot)
   - v1.7.0 shows both 20 SMA and 21 EMA (2 separate plots)
   - If upgrading, expect visual change (improvement)

---

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need all 10 systems active?**
A: No! Start with 3-4 (TD, EMA, Regime Box recommended). Add systems as you learn them. All 10 at once = overwhelming for beginners.

**Q: Can Omnideck replace multiple separate indicators?**
A: Yes - that's the entire point. One Omnideck = 10+ separate indicators consolidated. Better performance, consistent logic, unified design.

**Q: What's the performance impact vs separate indicators?**
A: Omnideck is OPTIMIZED. Shared calculations, smart label budgeting, zoom-aware rendering. Often FASTER than running 10 separate scripts.

**Q: Which system is most important?**
A: **Regime Box** - it's your bias filter. Everything else provides timing within that bias.

**Q: Can I customize colors/styles?**
A: Yes! Every system has independent color/style settings. Create your own visual theme.

**Q: Does this work on Forex?**
A: Yes! All systems work. Squeeze detection particularly effective on Forex due to volatility cycles.

**Q: What timeframe works best?**
A: All timeframes supported. Sweet spots:
- Scalping: 5m-15m (Squeeze, Sweeps, Patterns)
- Day trading: 1H (All systems)
- Swing: Daily (TD, EMA, Zones, Regime)

**Q: Why doesn't every TD sequence reach 9?**
A: Sequences reset if price reverses. This is normal DeMark behavior. Focus on the 9s that complete - those are the important signals.

**Q: Can I get overwhelmed by signals?**
A: Yes, if all 10 systems active on lower timeframes. Solution:
1. Use Regime Box as primary filter
2. Only take signals aligned with regime
3. Disable systems you don't understand yet

**Q: What's the best starter strategy?**
A: "Regime + Squeeze" setup (see Strategy Examples above). Simple, visual, high probability.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Minimal, Add Gradually**
   - Week 1: Regime Box + TD Sequential only
   - Week 2: Add Squeeze Detector
   - Week 3: Add EMA Trio
   - Week 4: Add one more system
   - Don't rush - master each system before adding next

2. **Always Check Regime First**
   - Regime Box color = your trading bias
   - Green = only look for longs
   - Red = only look for shorts
   - Gray = be very selective or stay flat
   - This ONE rule will massively improve results

3. **Combine Systems for Confluence**
   - One signal = interesting
   - Two signals = worth attention
   - Three+ signals = high probability (take it!)
   - Example: TD 9 + LL Sweep + Demand Zone + Hammer = ELITE setup

4. **Use Zones as Context**
   - Signals at SD zones = much higher probability
   - Signals in no man's land = lower probability
   - Elite zones (⭐⭐⭐) = prioritize these

5. **Respect the EMA 200**
   - Price above = bias bullish (take longs)
   - Price below = bias bearish (take shorts)
   - Chop at EMA 200 = wait for clarity
   - Golden/Death Cross = major trend change

6. **Let Squeezes Compress**
   - Minimum 3-5 dots before expecting breakout
   - More dots = bigger move potential
   - Premature breakouts (1-2 dots) = lower quality

7. **Filter TD Sequential**
   - TD 9 in strong regime = reversal likely
   - TD 9 against regime = less reliable
   - Combine with patterns for confirmation

8. **Clean Your Chart**
   - Hide systems you're not actively using
   - Prevents decision paralysis
   - Omnideck is powerful but can be visually busy
