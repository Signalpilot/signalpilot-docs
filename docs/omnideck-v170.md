## The 10 Systems (Choose What You Need)

### 1. üî¢ TD Sequential - Exhaustion Counter

**What you see:** Green numbers 1-9 below bars, Red numbers 1-9 above bars

**What it means:**
- **Green 9** = Price has been falling too long, potential reversal UP likely
- **Red 9** = Price has been rising too long, potential reversal DOWN likely

**What to do:** Wait for 9, look for potential reversal confirmation, then enter opposite direction

**Example:** Price falling for 9 bars (shows green 9 at $100) ‚Üí Look for long entry, early-cycle conditions may be developing

---

### 2. üí• Squeeze - Breakout Detector

**What you see:**
- **Red dots on price** = Volatility compressing (big move coming)
- **Green arrow ‚Üë** = Bullish breakout (go long)
- **Red arrow ‚Üì** = Bearish breakdown (go short)

**What to do:**
1. Wait for red dots (squeeze forming)
2. Let 3-5 dots cluster (more = bigger move)
3. Arrow fires ‚Üí Enter in arrow direction

**Example:** 5 red dots appear, then green arrow at $102 ‚Üí Enter long, explosive move starting

---

### 3. üíß Liquidity Sweeps - Stop Hunt Detector

**What you see:**
- **LL tag** = Lower Low sweep (fake breakdown)
- **HH tag** = Higher High sweep (fake breakout)

**What it means:**
- Price spiked to grab stops, then immediately reversed
- Classic "trap" move

**What to do:**
- **LL sweep** (bullish) ‚Üí Enter long, stop hunt completed
- **HH sweep** (bearish) ‚Üí Enter short, fake breakout

**Example:** Price drops to $98 (LL tag), immediately bounces to $102 ‚Üí Classic stop hunt, go long

---

### 4. üìä EMA Trio - The Big Three Moving Averages

**What you see:** Three lines - EMA 50 (fast), EMA 100 (medium), EMA 200 (slow)

**Key signals:**
- **Golden Cross (GC)** = Fast crosses above slow (bullish)
- **Death Cross (DC)** = Fast crosses below slow (bearish)
- **Pullback (PB)** = Price touches EMA then bounces (entry opportunity)

**Example:** Price above all 3 EMAs (50>100>200) = Strong uptrend, only take longs

---

### 5. üéØ SuperTrend - Trend Confirmation

**What you see:**
- **Green ribbon** = Bullish trend (only look for longs)
- **Red ribbon** = Bearish trend (only look for shorts)

**Why it helps:** Keeps you on the right side of the trend. Don't fight the ribbon color.

**Example:** Green ribbon + TD 9 green = Oversold in uptrend ‚Üí Strong buy

---

### 6. üìâ BMSB - Bull Market Support Band

**What you see:** Two lines close together (20 SMA + 21 EMA)

**What it is:** The "support zone" in uptrends

**What to do:**
- In uptrend: Buy when price touches BMSB
- Price breaks below BMSB = Trend weakening, be careful

**Example:** Stock in uptrend pulls back to BMSB at $105, bounces ‚Üí Buy the dip

---

### 7. üåà Regime Box - Market Mood Background

**What you see:**
- **Green background** = Bullish regime (take longs)
- **Red background** = Bearish regime (take shorts)
- **Gray background** = Neutral/choppy (be selective)

**Why it helps:** Your ultimate "bias filter." Only trade WITH the background color.

**Example:** Regime green + Squeeze arrow up = Maximum conviction long

---

### 8. üì¶ Supply/Demand Zones - Institutional Levels

**What you see:**
- **Green boxes** = Demand zones (support, price should bounce)
- **Red boxes** = Supply zones (resistance, price should reject)
- **Stars ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê** = Quality rating (more stars = stronger zone)

**What to do:**
1. Wait for price to reach zone
2. Watch for reaction (bounce or break)
3. Enter in the direction of the reaction

**Example:** Price drops to ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê demand zone at $100, forms hammer ‚Üí Enter long

---

### 9. üïØÔ∏è Candlestick Patterns - Classic Reversals

**What you see:** Labels like "HAM" (Hammer), "BE" (Bullish Engulfing), "SS" (Shooting Star)

**What they are:** 16 classic potential reversal patterns detected automatically

**What to do:** Pattern + other confirmations = Potential high-probability trade

**Example:** Shooting Star at supply zone + TD 9 red = Potential late-cycle exhaustion, example short setup

---

### 10. üéõÔ∏è Meta Tools - Everything Working Together

**What it is:** Behind-the-scenes integration that makes all systems work in harmony

**Example:** When all systems align (Regime green + Squeeze up + TD exhaustion + Demand zone + Hammer) = ELITE setup

---

## How to Use It (Don't Overwhelm Yourself!)

### Step 1: Start Simple (Beginner)

Don't turn on all 10 systems at once! Start with 3-4:

**Recommended starter combo:**
- ‚úÖ TD Sequential (exhaustion signals)
- ‚úÖ Squeeze Detector (breakout arrows)
- ‚úÖ EMA Trio (trend context)
- ‚úÖ Regime Box (bias filter)
- ‚ùå Other systems (add later)

---

### Step 2: Follow the Hierarchy

**Check in this order:**

1. **Regime Box** (background color) = Your bias
2. **EMA Trio / BMSB** = Trend structure
3. **TD / Squeeze / Sweeps** = Entry timing

**Example:**
1. Regime = Green (bullish)
2. Price above BMSB (uptrend confirmed)
3. TD 9 green (oversold)
4. Squeeze arrow fires up
5. = ENTER LONG (everything aligned)

---

### Step 3: Use Zones as Context

Signals at Supply/Demand zones = Much higher probability

**Example:**
- Regular signal (no zone) = 55% win rate
- Signal at ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê zone = 75% win rate

Always prefer signals that happen at key zones.

---

## Real Example (Bitcoin)

**Setup:**
- Price: $64,000, falling
- **Regime Box** = Red (bearish... but check for reversal)
- **TD Sequential** = Green 9 (oversold exhaustion)
- **Demand Zone** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê at $63,500
- **Liquidity Sweep** = LL tag at $63,200
- **Hammer** pattern forms

**The Trade:**
1. Price sweeps $63,200 (LL liquidity sweep)
2. Bounces into demand zone
3. TD shows green 9 (exhaustion)
4. Hammer indicates potential reversal
5. You enter long at $63,800
6. Stop below zone at $63,000

**Result:**
- Price rallies to $68,000
- Regime flips to green at $65,000 (confirmation)
- Exit at next supply zone = $4,200 profit per coin (6.6% gain)

---

## Settings (Keep It Simple)

**System Toggles:**
Each of the 10 systems can be turned on/off independently

**My recommendation:**
- Week 1: TD + Squeeze + EMA + Regime
- Week 2: Add BMSB + SuperTrend
- Week 3: Add Zones + Patterns
- Week 4: Use all 10 once you understand each

**Colors:**
Customize to your preference, but keep it clean

**Regime Mode:**
- Conservative = Fewer but stronger signals
- Balanced = Default (recommended)
- Aggressive = More signals, requires more filtering

---

## Alerts (Set These!)

**Must-have alerts:**
1. **TD Buy 9** = Oversold exhaustion
2. **TD Sell 9** = Overbought exhaustion
3. **Squeeze Break Up** = Bullish explosion
4. **Squeeze Break Down** = Bearish explosion
5. **Golden Cross** = Major bullish signal
6. **Death Cross** = Major bearish signal

**How to set:**
1. Click alarm icon
2. Select "Omnideck v1.0"
3. Choose which signal
4. Set to "Once Per Bar Close"

---

## Common Mistakes (Avoid These!)

‚ùå **Using all 10 systems at once as a beginner**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Start with 3-4 systems, add more as you learn each one

‚ùå **Ignoring the Regime Box**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Regime = Your bias. Always check it first. Don't fight it.

‚ùå **Trading every signal**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Best signals have multiple confirmations (TD 9 + Sweep + Zone + Pattern)

‚ùå **Taking signals against the trend**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Regime green + bullish signals = Good. Regime green + bearish signals = Skip.

‚ùå **Forgetting about Supply/Demand zones**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Signals at zones = Much higher success rate

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need all 10 systems?**
**A:** No! Most traders use 4-6 systems. Start small, add gradually. All 10 at once = overwhelming.

**Q: What's the most important system?**
**A:** **Regime Box** - it provides directional bias context. Other components provide timing signals within that context.

**Q: Which combo works best?**
**A:** Personal favorite: Regime + TD + Squeeze + Zones. Simple, powerful, high win rate.

**Q: How often do TD 9 signals appear?**
**A:** Depends on timeframe:
- 5m chart: Several per day
- 1H chart: 2-3 per week
- Daily chart: 1-2 per month

**Q: Does it work on all markets?**
**A:** Yes! Crypto, stocks, futures, forex, indices - all work great.

**Q: Does it repaint?**
**A:** No. All signals lock in at bar close. What you see is what you get.

**Q: Can this replace multiple indicators?**
**A:** Yes - that's the point! One Omnideck = 10+ separate indicators combined.
