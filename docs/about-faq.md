# FAQ

**Does it repaint?**  
No—signals finalize on candle close; HTF data confirms first. See [Non‑Repainting Policy](ref-non-repaint.md).

**Which markets/timeframes?**  
Anything on TradingView: crypto, FX, indices, equities, commodities — scalps to swings.

**How do I get access?**  
Invite‑only via TradingView username after purchase.

**Can I automate?**  
Yes—use close‑confirmed alerts and [Webhooks](how-to-webhooks.md).

**Why don’t I see an event that happened intrabar?**  
Events only print on **closed** bars by design.
