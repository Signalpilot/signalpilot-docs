# SP — Structure Map (SML) — by Signal Pilot
*A clean, anchored map of trend changes and high‑interest zones. No repaint.*  

**Website:** https://www.signalpilot.io  
**Platform:** TradingView (Pine v6)  
**Markets:** Crypto • Forex • Stocks • Futures (any symbol, any timeframe)

---

## ✨ What it does (in plain English)

Structure Map (SML) automatically draws the stuff most traders try to draw by hand:

- 🔄 **Trend breaks & flips** — BOS/CHOCH (structure continues or changes)
- 📏 **Equal Highs / Equal Lows** — flat areas price loves to tag
- 🧹 **Sweeps** — quick “stop‑runs” that poke above/below a swing and snap back
- 🕳️ **Gaps (FVGs)** — holes from fast moves that price often revisits
- 🧱 **Order Blocks (OBs)** — strong launch zones  
  - 🔁 **Breakers** — failed OBs that flip role (support ↔ resistance)

It’s designed to be **clean**, **anchored**, and **non‑repainting** — what you saw at candle close stays that way.  
Use SML as a **map** of likely reaction areas — **not** as a buy/sell button.

---

## ⏱️ TL;DR Setup (2 minutes)

1. ➕ **Add SML to your chart**.  
2. ⚙️ Open **Settings → SP:Display → SP:Mode** and choose **Clean Ultra** (least clutter).  
3. 🧭 Read the chart with this quick legend:
   - 🟩/**teal** = bullish • 🟥/**maroon** = bearish • 🩶/**gray** = neutral reference  
   - **BOS** = trend continuation • **CHOCH** = possible trend flip  
   - 🩶 **flat line** = Equal High/Low (common target/magnet)  
   - 🔺/🔻 **triangle** = a **Sweep** just happened  
   - 🧊 **boxes** = zones where price may react:
     - 🕳️ **FVG** = gap likely to be revisited
     - 🧱 **OB** = launch zone (often S/R)
     - 🔁 **BRK** on a box = breaker (failed OB that flipped)

> 💡 **Pro tip:** Learn on **15m** or **1h**. Keep **Clean Ultra** until you’re comfortable.

## 🎯 Quick Playbook (examples, not signals)

- **Pullback to a Gap (FVG)**  
  👀 See **BOS up** → a **bull FVG** forms below → if price returns into it and stabilizes, buyers often defend.

- **Retest the Block (OB)**  
  👀 See **CHOCH up** → a **bull OB** appears → a calm retest can bounce.

- **Fade a Sweep**  
  👀 A **sweep up** (triangle above a recent high) that **closes back below** can invite short attempts *if your plan allows*.

⚠️ Always follow your own entry/exit/risk rules.

---

## 🔔 Alerts (simple and useful)

Built‑in alert presets:
- ✅ **Bullish OB Created**
- ✅ **Bearish OB Created**

Want more? Create alerts from SML’s hidden **boolean** signals (e.g., new BOS/CHOCH, new FVG, new EQH/EQL, sweep up/down).  
🔒 Best practice: fire alerts **on candle close** and on the **timeframe you trade**.

---

## ⚙️ Settings — start here, ignore the rest (for now)

- **Mode:**  
  - 🌿 **Clean Ultra** → minimal & beginner‑friendly (**recommended**)  
  - 🧰 Standard / 🧨 Verbose → show more lines/boxes and labels

- **Structure (BOS/CHOCH):** ✅ Defaults are fine.  
- **Equal Highs/Lows:** ✅ Keep on; default tolerance works.  
- **Sweeps:** 🧹 Optional. Want fewer triangles? Increase **Cooldown** or **Min ticks**.  
- **FVG:** 🕳️ Keep on; default **Min gap** is fine. “Mitigation = Close” is beginner‑friendly.  
- **Order Blocks:** 🧱 Keep on; **Body‑based OB** is simple. “Breakers on” is fine.

You can tweak later — the defaults keep charts clean.

---

## 🎨 Color cheat‑sheet

- 🟩/**teal** = bullish things (upside structure/zones)  
- 🟥/**maroon** = bearish things (downside structure/zones)  
- 🩶/**gray** = neutral references (equal highs/lows, mid‑lines)

---

## 🧭 Glossary (no jargon)

- **BOS** — *Break of Structure*: trend continues by pushing through a prior level.  
- **CHOCH** — *Change of Character*: price breaks the other way (possible flip).  
- **EQH / EQL** — *Equal Highs/Lows*: two similar swing highs/lows → flat target area.  
- **Sweep** — price wicks above/below a swing then closes back in (stop‑run).  
- **FVG** — *Fair Value Gap*: a mini “hole” after a fast move; often revisited.  
- **OB** — *Order Block*: last opposite candle before a strong move; acts as a zone.  
- **Breaker (BRK)** — an OB that failed and flipped role (support ↔ resistance).

## 🚫 What NOT to expect

- ❌ Not a buy/sell machine  
- 🔮 Not a crystal ball  
- ✅ It’s a **map** that highlights **where** decisions often happen; **you** decide **if/when** to trade

## ❓ FAQ

**Does it repaint?**  
🟢 **No.** Signals lock at candle close. What you saw on close stays.

**Which timeframe should I learn on?**  
🎓 The one you actually trade. Many start with **15m** or **1h**.

**Why did a box disappear?**  
🧽 It was **mitigated** (your setting for touch/close) or it **aged out** (auto clean‑up).

**Can I use it on crypto/forex/stocks/futures?**  
🌍 Yes — anything available on TradingView.

**Too many signals?**  
🧹 Use **Clean Ultra** and tighten filters: raise Sweep **Cooldown** / **Min ticks**, raise FVG **Min gap**, and keep **Hide mitigated** on.

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting

- **I can’t see much** → try **Verbose** briefly to learn, then return to **Clean Ultra**.  
- **Cluttered chart** → increase **Max Draw Age** or lower the caps (how many zones to keep).  
- **Alerts too chatty** → raise thresholds (e.g., Sweep **Min ticks**) or step up a timeframe.
