# SP — Momentum Matrix (Panel Pro) — by Signal Pilot

**What this is**  
A simple panel that tells you if momentum is mostly **up**, **down**, or **mixed**.  
Think of it like a weather report for your chart.

- **Green = pressure up** (buyers in control)
- **Red = pressure down** (sellers in control)
- **Gray = mixed/neutral**

Works on **any market** and **any timeframe** (crypto, stocks, FX, indices).

> ⚠️ Education only. Not financial advice.  
> ✔️ Non‑repainting: signals confirm **after the candle closes** (no “ghost” signals).

## 60‑second setup

1) **Add to chart**  
   TradingView → *Pine Editor* → paste the script → **Add to chart** (it shows in its own panel).

2) **Leave defaults alone**  
   They’re fine for most charts.

3) **Pick a timeframe**  
   - 15–30m or 1H are great places to start.  
   - 1–5m is noisy (expect more flips).

Done.

## What you’re looking at (no jargon)

The panel has three parts:

1) **Composite line** (the main line)  
   - Blends several momentum tools into one score from **0–100**.  
   - **Above 50 = bullish bias**, **below 50 = bearish bias**.

2) **Signal line** (a smoother guide)  
   - **Composite crossing above** it → **possible turn up**.  
   - **Composite crossing below** it → **possible turn down**.

3) **Momentum matrix (colored ribbon)**  
   - Rows show what each underlying indicator “thinks.”  
   - **Lots of green rows** = broad agreement up. **Lots of red** = broad agreement down.  
   - You can show **Blocks** (tiles) or **Stripes** (continuous band).

> Tip: If your chart feels slow, switch the matrix style to **Stripes**.

## How to use it (quick rules)

**For possible LONG bias (up):**
- Composite **already above 50** ✅  
- Composite **crosses up** through the signal line ✅  
- Matrix shows **more green than red** ✅

**For possible SHORT bias (down):**
- Composite **already below 50** ✅  
- Composite **crosses down** through the signal line ✅  
- Matrix shows **more red than green** ✅

**When to ignore:**
- Colors are mostly gray/mixed and the composite hovers around 50 ❌  
- It flips up/down every few candles (very choppy session) ❌  
- You’re trading straight into major news or against a strong higher‑timeframe move ❌

---

## Alerts (set it and forget it)

1) Right‑click chart → **Add alert**.  
2) Choose a built‑in condition and set **Once Per Bar Close**:

- **XUP** — composite crossed **above** the signal line (possible up turn)  
- **XDN** — composite crossed **below** the signal line (possible down turn)  
- **OB** — composite entered **Overbought** (very hot)  
- **OS** — composite entered **Oversold** (very cold)  
- **50UP** — composite crossed **above 50** (bullish bias)  
- **50DN** — composite crossed **below 50** (bearish bias)

You’ll be alerted **after** the candle closes.

---

## Two optional helpers (nice, not required)

- **FlipGuard** — a built‑in **seatbelt** that ignores flimsy flips in chop.  
  Translation: **fewer false starts**.

- **HTF Assist** — lets a **higher timeframe** (like 1H or 1D) “vote” with you.  
  Example: Trading the 15m chart? Ask the 1H to agree first for stricter entries.

> New to this? Leave both at defaults for a while. Turn on **HTF Assist** later if you want fewer, cleaner signals.

---

## Easy presets (start here)

**Intraday (15–30m)**  
- Defaults are fine.  
- Want fewer but cleaner signals? Turn on **HTF Assist = 60m**.

**Swing (4H–1D)**  
- Defaults are fine.  
- Extra safety: **HTF Assist = 1D** (for 4H) or **W** (for 1D).

**Scalp (1–5m)**  
- Expect more noise. Use **Stripes** ribbon.  
- Strongly consider **HTF Assist = 60m** to filter junk.

---

## Quick fixes (common questions)

**“It changed after I added it—repainting?!”**  
No. Signals confirm at **bar close**. Mid‑candle movement is normal on every indicator.

**“Where’s the colored ribbon?”**  
Turn on **Show heat‑matrix** in settings. If it’s cramped, increase **Row spacing** or switch to **Stripes**.

**“Too many alerts/whipsaws.”**  
Use a slightly higher timeframe (e.g., 30m instead of 5m), or turn on **HTF Assist**,  
or wait for **>50 (for longs) / <50 (for shorts)** **and** clear color agreement.

**“Can I scan for signals?”**  
Yes (advanced). The script includes hidden true/false outputs for scanners. Beginners can skip this.

---

## What the settings mean (plain English)

- **Overbought / Oversold** — “really hot” / “really cold.” Use as **context**, not auto buy/sell.  
- **Normalization lookback** — how far back we score 0–100. Bigger = smoother.  
- **Composite smoothing** — makes the main line less jittery.  
- **Matrix style** — **Blocks** (easy to spot changes) or **Stripes** (lighter).  
- **HTF Assist** — a bigger timeframe gets a vote (e.g., 1H or 1D).  
- **Require >50 for longs / <50 for shorts** — don’t fight the tide.  
- **Minimum consensus** — how many “yes” votes you want before you act (higher = pickier).

If that felt like a lot—leave defaults on. You’ll be fine.

---

## Safety checklist

- Wait for the candle to **close** before acting.  
- Prefer trades **with the current bias** (above 50 for longs, below 50 for shorts).  
- Want extra safety? **Ask a higher timeframe to agree** (turn on HTF Assist).  
- No indicator replaces a plan. Use stops and sensible position sizing.
