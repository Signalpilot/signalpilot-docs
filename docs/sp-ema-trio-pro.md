# SP — Trend Stack (EMA 50/100/200 Pro) GC/DC + PB —  by Signal Pilot

A simple, reliable way to **see the trend** and **spot key moments** on your chart.

- **Golden Cross (GC)** and **Death Cross (DC)** labels tell you when the trend may be changing.
- **Pullback dots (PB)** show clean “dip/bounce back into the trend.”
- **PB1** highlights the **first pullback after a new GC/DC** — the one most traders care about.
- **EMA200 Reclaim/Reject** marks strength/weakness around the 200 EMA.
- **No repainting:** signals appear only after the candle closes.
- **Alerts included** so you don’t have to stare at the screen.

## Legend (what you’ll see on the chart)

- **Blue “GC” label** – Golden Cross (EMA50 crosses **above** EMA200)
- **Red “DC” label** – Death Cross (EMA50 crosses **below** EMA200)
- **Green dot** – Pullback **long** in an uptrend
- **Red dot** – Pullback **short** in a downtrend
- **Aqua dot** – **First** pullback after a GC (PB1)
- **Fuchsia dot** – **First** pullback after a DC (PB1)
- **Teal tiny circle under a bar** – Price **reclaimed** the EMA200 (strength)
- **Purple tiny circle above a bar** – Price **rejected** the EMA200 (weakness)

> If a bar is “busy,” the indicator shows only the **most important** event:
> **GC/DC → EMA200 Reclaim/Reject → PB** (in that order).

## Quick Start (60 seconds)

## The super‑simple playbook

**After a Blue “GC”**  
- Trend may be turning **up**.  
- Watch for the **Aqua dot** (PB1) — the **first dip after the turn**.  
- Later **Green dots** are regular pullbacks in the uptrend.

**After a Red “DC”**  
- Trend may be turning **down**.  
- Watch for the **Fuchsia dot** (PB1) — the **first bounce after the turn**.  
- Later **Red dots** are regular pullbacks in the downtrend.

**Around the 200 EMA**  
- **Teal circle (below bar)** = price got back **above** the 200 (extra strength).  
- **Purple circle (above bar)** = price got pushed **below** the 200 (extra weakness).

## Alerts (copy these names exactly)

All alerts fire **on candle close** (so they don’t repaint):

- `SP:EMA | GOLDEN_CROSS` – EMA50 crossed **above** EMA200  
- `SP:EMA | DEATH_CROSS` – EMA50 crossed **below** EMA200  
- `SP:EMA | PB1_AFTER_GC` – first pullback after a Golden Cross  
- `SP:EMA | PB1_AFTER_DC` – first pullback after a Death Cross  
- `SP:EMA | PB_LONG` – pullback long in an uptrend  
- `SP:EMA | PB_SHORT` – pullback short in a downtrend  
- `SP:EMA | 200_RECLAIM` – price reclaimed the EMA200  
- `SP:EMA | 200_REJECT` – price rejected the EMA200

> **Note:** Alert titles use the original “SP:EMA” naming for backward compatibility.

## Settings (only if you want to tweak)

The default settings are conservative and work out of the box.  
If you open the code, the tweakable bits are at the top:

- **EMAs:** 50 / 100 / 200  
- **Cooldown:** waits **10 bars** before the **same** signal can fire again  
- **PB1 window:** PB1 must happen within **60 bars** after a new GC/DC  
- **Strict PB:** pullbacks must also agree with EMA100 (keeps signals cleaner)  
- **ATR guardrails (optional):** faint bands around the 200 EMA (off by default)

## FAQ

**What’s an EMA?**  
A moving average that gives more weight to recent prices.

**What is a Golden/Death Cross?**  
EMA50 crossing the EMA200. Above = Golden (up). Below = Death (down).

**What does “non‑repainting” mean?**  
Signals only appear **after** the candle closes, so they don’t change later.

**Does this place trades for me?**  
No. It’s a **reading tool** for trend and pullbacks. Use your own risk rules.

## Troubleshooting

- **“My alert came in late.”** Alerts are **close‑confirmed** by design.  
- **“I saw a cross but no PB dot.”** That bar likely had a higher‑priority event (normal).  
- **“Too many dots.”** Keep “Strict PB” on or increase the cooldown value.

## Notes for existing users

- Previously called **“SP: EMA Trio PRO • GC/DC Text + PB1.”**  
- The indicator name is now **Trend Stack (EMA 50/100/200 Pro)**.  
- **Alert names and hidden screener fields** still use the `SP:EMA` convention so your existing alerts and screeners don’t break.

---
