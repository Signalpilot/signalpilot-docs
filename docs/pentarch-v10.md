# Pentarch v1.0 - Five Cycle Events

## üéØ Cycle-Aware Detection
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600;">Core Functionality</span>

Most indicators show signals. Pentarch shows cycles.

Markets move in cycles. Every asset. Every timeframe. Pentarch identifies cycle position across five distinct events: accumulation, markup, distribution, climax, and decline.

**The Five Cycle Events:** TD ‚Üí IGN ‚Üí WRN ‚Üí CAP ‚Üí BDN

**Four-layer detection system:** Regime classification ‚Üí Pilot Line filter ‚Üí NanoFlow momentum ‚Üí Event signals. All layers confirm at bar close before signals fire.

## üî¢ The Five Cycle Events
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Complete Cycle Framework</span>

### üîµ TD - Touchdown (Accumulation Phase)

**Visual:** Blue "TD" label below the candle

**Cycle Position:** Early-cycle accumulation. Identifies potential reversal from decline into accumulation phase.

**What Pentarch Detects:**
- Price extended below Pilot Line (oversold conditions)
- Multi-factor confirmation across regime, distance, and momentum
- Close-confirmed signal at bar close

**Common Usage:**
- Accumulation phase marker
- IGN signal often follows for markup confirmation
- TD functions as cycle awareness rather than immediate entry trigger

**Example:** Stock declines from $100 to $85, TD fires ‚Üí Accumulation phase identified

---

### üü¢ IGN - Ignition (Markup Phase)

**Visual:** Green "IGN" label below the candle

**Cycle Position:** Markup phase beginning. Identifies transition from accumulation into bullish momentum expansion.

**What Pentarch Detects:**
- Momentum breakout conditions confirmed
- Price structure shifting bullish
- All four layers aligned at bar close

**Common Usage:**
- Markup phase entry marker
- Evaluated at bar close or following bar
- Stop placement typically below recent structural low

**Example:** After TD at $85, IGN fires at $87 ‚Üí Markup phase identified, commonly used for long entry

---

### üü° WRN - Warning (Distribution Phase)

**Visual:** Yellow "WRN" label above the candle

**Cycle Position:** Distribution phase. Identifies potential transition from markup into distribution.

**What Pentarch Detects:**
- Price extended above Pilot Line
- Weakening momentum conditions
- Distribution characteristics emerging

**Common Usage:**
- Distribution phase warning
- Risk management adjustments (stop tightening)
- Position sizing consideration for new entries

**Example:** Stock rallies to $115, WRN fires ‚Üí Distribution phase identified

---

### üî¥ CAP - Climax (Climax Phase)

**Visual:** Red "CAP" label above the candle

**Cycle Position:** Climax exhaustion. Identifies late-cycle peak before potential decline.

**What Pentarch Detects:**
- Extreme extension from Pilot Line
- Exhaustion characteristics across all layers
- Climax conditions confirmed at close

**Common Usage:**
- Climax phase marker
- Long position exit consideration
- Short position preparation for experienced traders

**Example:** After WRN at $115, CAP fires at $120 ‚Üí Climax phase identified

---

### ‚ö´ BDN - Breakdown (Decline Phase)

**Visual:** Dark "BDN" label above the candle

**Cycle Position:** Decline phase initiation. Identifies structural breakdown into bearish cycle.

**What Pentarch Detects:**
- Bearish structure break confirmed
- Transition from climax into decline phase
- Four-layer bearish alignment at close

**Common Usage:**
- Decline phase confirmation
- Long position exit if not already completed
- Short position entry for directional traders

**Example:** After CAP at $120, BDN fires at $113 ‚Üí Decline phase confirmed

## üìö Common Usage Patterns
<span style="color: #8b5cf6; font-weight: 600;">How Traders Use It</span>

### Signal Observation

Adding Pentarch to your chart displays labels automatically when events occur.

### Typical Signal Flow Patterns

**For Long Positions:**
1. TD appears ‚Üí Often interpreted as preparation signal
2. IGN appears ‚Üí Commonly used as potential long entry signal
3. WRN appears ‚Üí Many traders begin monitoring for exits
4. CAP or BDN appears ‚Üí Often interpreted as exit signal

**For Short Positions:**
1. WRN appears ‚Üí Often interpreted as preparation signal
2. CAP appears ‚Üí Many traders prepare for potential short opportunities
3. BDN appears ‚Üí Commonly used as potential short entry signal
4. TD or IGN appears ‚Üí Often interpreted as exit signal for shorts

### Risk Management Considerations

Stop loss usage is a standard risk management practice:
- For long positions: Common stop placement is below the TD low
- For short positions: Common stop placement is above the CAP high

## Educational Example (Bitcoin)

**The Setup:**
- Price: $35,000, falling for weeks
- **TD** appears at $32,500 ‚Üí "Early-cycle conditions developing"
- **IGN** fires at $33,800 ‚Üí "Potential reversal indicated" ‚úÖ
- Hypothetical entry at $33,900

**The Trade:**
- Price rallies to $42,000
- **WRN** appears at $41,500 ‚Üí "Monitoring phase begins"
- **CAP** fires at $42,800 ‚Üí "Late-cycle exhaustion indicated" ‚úÖ
- Hypothetical exit at $42,500

**Educational Result:** $8,600 potential gain per coin (25%) in this theoretical scenario

## üéØ The Pilot Line - Your Trend Compass
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">‚≠ê Core Component - Primary Reference for All Signals</span>

### What Is It?

The **Pilot Line** is a smooth trend line that acts as your primary reference point. Think of it as the "center of gravity" for price action. Every one of the 5 event signals is positioned relative to this line.

**Visual:** A thick line on your chart that changes color:
- **üü¢ Green** = Strong uptrend (slope rising, momentum strong)
- **üî¥ Red** = Strong downtrend (slope falling, momentum strong)
- **üü† Orange** = Transitional phase (momentum easing or flat)

**The Ribbon:** You'll also see two semi-transparent bands above and below the line. This is the "influence zone" (¬±0.25 ATR). Price within the ribbon = balanced. Price outside the ribbon = extended.

### Why It Matters

The Pilot Line serves multiple purposes:

1. **Trend Filter** - Shows you the current trend direction at a glance
2. **Reference Point** - All event signals measure their distance FROM the Pilot Line
3. **Dynamic Support/Resistance** - Price tends to react when approaching or crossing the line
4. **Regime Component** - One of 3 factors that determine regime state (more below)

### How to Read It

| Pilot Line Color | Market State | What Traders Often Look For |
|------------------|--------------|------------------------------|
| üü¢ **Green** | Strong uptrend | Pullback opportunities (TD/IGN signals) |
| üî¥ **Red** | Strong downtrend | Rally reversals (WRN/CAP/BDN signals) |
| üü† **Orange** | Transitional/Uncertain | Trend weakening, exercise caution |

**Key Insight:** The Pilot Line doesn't give direct entry signals. Instead, it provides context for the 5 event candles. An IGN signal above a green Pilot Line has different implications than an IGN signal below a red Pilot Line.

### Common Usage Patterns

**Distance Context:**
- TD signals typically appear near or below the Pilot Line (potential bottoms)
- WRN/CAP signals typically appear above the Pilot Line (potential tops)
- Distance from PL measured in ATR units (normalized for volatility)

**Pilot Line Crosses:**
- Price crossing above PL = Potential bullish structural shift
- Price crossing below PL = Potential bearish structural shift
- You can set alerts for PL crosses if desired

**Color Transitions:**
- Green ‚Üí Orange = Uptrend losing momentum
- Orange ‚Üí Red = Downtrend establishing
- Watching for color changes can provide early warning of trend shifts

### Technical Note

The Pilot Line is a double-smoothed EMA (34-period EMA, then 3-period EMA of that result). This makes it:
- Fast enough to catch reversals early
- Smooth enough to filter out noise
- Non-repainting (locked in after bar close)

## üé® Regime Bar Colors - Know Your Market Structure
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üìä Visual Context - Instant Market Structure Feedback</span>

### What Is It?

Pentarch automatically **colors every candle** on your chart to show the current market regime. This provides instant visual feedback about trend structure without reading any indicator values.

**You'll see:**
- **üü¢ Green Candles** = Bull regime active (uptrend structure)
- **üî¥ Red Candles** = Bear regime active (downtrend structure)
- **Colored Event Candles** = When TD/IGN/WRN/CAP/BDN fires, that specific candle shows the event color instead

### How Regime Is Determined

Regime uses a **3-factor voting system**:

1. **EMA Structure:** Is the 34-period EMA above the 55-period EMA? (+1 vote for bull)
2. **Price vs Pilot Line:** Is price above the Pilot Line? (+1 vote for bull)
3. **Slope Direction:** Is the Pilot Line sloping up? (+1 vote for bull)

**Regime Changes When:**
- 2 out of 3 factors vote for the opposite direction
- AND this condition holds for 2-4 bars (prevents whipsaw on single spikes)

### Why It Matters

**Trading Bias:** The regime colors guide your directional bias:
- **Green regime** ‚Üí Many traders look for long opportunities (TD/IGN)
- **Red regime** ‚Üí Many traders look for short opportunities (WRN/CAP/BDN)

**Signal Context:** The same price level can have different implications depending on regime:
- $50,000 BTC in green regime = Potential support (pullback opportunity)
- $50,000 BTC in red regime = Potential resistance (rally reversal area)

**Trend Strength:**
- Long streaks of same color = Strong, sustained trend
- Frequent color changes = Choppy market, low conviction

### How Event Signals Relate to Regime

Most event signals require the "correct" regime to fire:

| Signal | Typical Regime Required | Exception Cases |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **TD** | Bear regime (red) | Can fire in bull regime if conditions are extreme |
| **IGN** | Bear regime (red) | Can fire in bull regime during pullbacks |
| **WRN** | Bull regime (green) | Can fire in bear regime if rally is strong enough |
| **CAP** | Bull regime (green) | Can fire in bear regime if conditions are extreme |
| **BDN** | Follows WRN/CAP | Regime-dependent on prior signal |

**Key Concept:** Regime acts as a filter. The indicator is "pickier" about firing counter-regime signals, requiring more extreme conditions to confirm them.

### Common Usage Patterns

**Regime Flips as Signals:**
- First green candle after red streak = Potential trend change to bullish
- First red candle after green streak = Potential trend change to bearish
- You can set alerts for regime flips

**Regime Confirmation:**
- Event signal + matching regime = Higher conviction
  - Example: IGN in red regime (standard reversal) vs IGN in green regime (pullback long entry)
  - Example: CAP in green regime (standard top) vs CAP in red regime (bear rally exhaustion)

**Whipsaw Considerations:**
- Regime doesn't flip on every bar - it requires sustained evidence
- This prevents false structural changes during normal noise
- Adjustable via settings if you want more/less sensitivity

## ‚ö° NanoFlow - The Momentum Heartbeat
<span style="color: #a855f7; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üîç Context Tool - NOT a Primary Trade Signal</span>

### What Is It?

**NanoFlow** is a high-frequency micro-momentum indicator that shows small-scale trend shifts between the main event signals. While TD/IGN/WRN/CAP/BDN fire 3-8 times per day (on 1H charts), NanoFlow can fire 10-30 times per day.

**Visual:** Small cross marks on your chart:
- **üü¢ Green cross BELOW the candle low** = Micro bullish momentum detected
- **üî¥ Red cross ABOVE the candle high** = Micro bearish momentum detected

**Style:** Subtle and semi-transparent (90% transparent) so they don't overwhelm the chart

### What It Shows

NanoFlow fires when ALL these conditions align:

**Bullish NanoFlow (Green Cross):**
- Fast EMA (9) is above Slow EMA (21) = Micro uptrend
- Current candle is green (close ‚â• open)
- Price is above the Pilot Line
- ‚Üí **Interpretation:** Bulls have micro-level control right now

**Bearish NanoFlow (Red Cross):**
- Fast EMA (9) is below Slow EMA (21) = Micro downtrend
- Current candle is red (close ‚â§ open)
- Price is below the Pilot Line
- ‚Üí **Interpretation:** Bears have micro-level control right now

### Key Differences from Main Signals

| Feature | NanoFlow | Main Events (TD/IGN/WRN/CAP/BDN) |
|---------|----------|----------------------------------|
| **Frequency** | High (10-30/day on 1H) | Low (3-8/day on 1H) |
| **Sensitivity** | Very sensitive (9 vs 21 EMA) | Multi-factor confirmation required |
| **Purpose** | Micro momentum tracking | Major reversal/continuation detection |
| **Visual** | Small subtle crosses | Large colored labels |
| **Actionability** | Context/confirmation tool | Primary trade signals |
| **Regime Dependent?** | No (can fire anytime) | Yes (mostly regime-specific) |

### How Traders Use NanoFlow

**‚ùå NOT a Trade Signal**
NanoFlow is NOT designed to be traded directly. It's too sensitive and fires too often.

**‚úÖ Context & Confirmation Tool**
NanoFlow helps you evaluate the quality and health of main event signals:

**1. Trend Health Check:**
- During uptrend: Lots of green NanoFlow = Healthy momentum
- During uptrend: No green NanoFlow = Momentum dying, trend weakening
- During downtrend: Lots of red NanoFlow = Healthy downside momentum
- During downtrend: No red NanoFlow = Weakness, potential reversal coming

**2. Event Signal Confirmation:**
- TD fires ‚Üí Green NanoFlow appears next bar = Good confirmation
- WRN fires ‚Üí Red NanoFlow appears next bar = Good confirmation
- IGN fires ‚Üí No green NanoFlow for 5+ bars = Weak signal, exercise caution

**3. Chop Detection:**
- NanoFlow flipping green/red/green/red rapidly = Choppy conditions where trading is often avoided
- NanoFlow absent entirely = Low volatility zone where traders typically await clearer setups

**4. Continuation Monitoring:**
- Many NanoFlow crosses in same direction = Strong trend, momentum sustained
- NanoFlow crosses stopping = Potential exhaustion, prepare for reversal

### Example Scenario

**Bitcoin 1H Chart:**

**Bars 1-10:** Green regime, green Pilot Line, green NanoFlow crosses every 2-3 bars
- **Interpretation:** Healthy uptrend with strong micro momentum

**Bar 11:** WRN fires (yellow label above candle), no green NanoFlow cross
- **Interpretation:** Warning signal + no bullish micro momentum = Top may be forming

**Bars 12-14:** Pilot Line turns orange, red NanoFlow crosses appear
- **Interpretation:** Momentum shifting bearish, transition phase

**Bar 15:** BDN fires (breakdown signal), red regime, red NanoFlow
- **Interpretation:** Full bearish structure confirmed

**Result:** NanoFlow helped confirm the quality of the WRN‚ÜíBDN sequence by showing momentum dying (green crosses stopped) then shifting (red crosses appeared).

### Settings

NanoFlow can be toggled on/off in TradingView settings:
- **Show NanoFlow Crosses** - Check to display, uncheck to hide
- **Useful for:** 5m, 15m, 1H charts (shows micro structure clearly)
- **Less useful for:** Daily+ charts (too many crosses, can add visual noise)

### Common Questions

**Q: Should I trade every NanoFlow cross?**
A: No. NanoFlow is confirmation for the main event signals, not a standalone entry trigger.

**Q: Why don't I see NanoFlow sometimes?**
A: NanoFlow only appears when ALL conditions are met (micro trend + candle color + correct side of Pilot Line). If any condition fails, no cross renders.

**Q: Can I use NanoFlow alone without the main signals?**
A: Not recommended. NanoFlow is designed to work WITH the 5 event signals, providing momentum context for them.

**Q: Does NanoFlow repaint?**
A: No. Like all Pentarch components, NanoFlow only renders on confirmed bars. What you see is locked in.

## üîÑ Four-Layer Detection System
<span style="color: #f59e0b; font-weight: 600; font-size: 1.1em;">üéì Transparency - How Pentarch Identifies Cycle Events</span>

### The Complete Detection Hierarchy

Pentarch uses a four-layer detection system to identify cycle events. All layers confirm at bar close before signals fire.

**Layer 1: Regime Bar Colors (Bull/Bear Classification)**
- Classifies every candle as bull regime (green) or bear regime (red)
- Three-factor voting system: EMA structure + Price vs Pilot + Pilot slope
- Provides directional bias for event detection
- Locks at bar close (non-repainting)

**Layer 2: Pilot Line (Momentum Trend Filter)**
- Dynamic trend reference line (green/red/orange)
- Measures price distance in ATR-normalized units
- Acts as filter for event detection (overbought/oversold relative to trend)
- Updates at bar close only

**Layer 3: NanoFlow Crosses (High-Frequency Momentum)**
- Micro-level momentum tracking (9 EMA vs 21 EMA)
- Provides momentum confirmation context
- Fires 10-30x more frequently than main events
- Validates trend health between events

**Layer 4: Event Signals (Five Cycle Markers)**
- TD/IGN/WRN/CAP/BDN cycle event labels
- Lowest frequency, highest conviction signals
- Requires alignment across all previous layers
- **Transparency guarantee:** All layers confirm at close = signal fires

### Example: Reading a Full Signal Sequence

**Setup Phase (Green Regime):**
- Candles: üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢ (all green - bull regime)
- Pilot Line: Green, sloping up
- NanoFlow: Green crosses every 2-3 bars (healthy momentum)
- Events: None yet
- **Interpretation:** Strong uptrend, look for pullback opportunities (TD/IGN)

**Warning Phase:**
- Candles: üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢üü¢üü° (WRN fires, yellow candle)
- Pilot Line: Still green but starting to ease (losing momentum)
- NanoFlow: No green crosses (bullish momentum died)
- Events: WRN signal (potential early top)
- **Interpretation:** Top warning, momentum fading, prepare for exit consideration

**Transition Phase:**
- Candles: üü†üü† (orange - regime transitioning)
- Pilot Line: Orange (easing slope)
- NanoFlow: Red cross appears (bearish micro momentum)
- Events: None
- **Interpretation:** Trend weakening, bearish pressure building

**Breakdown Phase:**
- Candles: üî¥ (first red candle - regime flipped to bear)
- Pilot Line: Now red
- NanoFlow: Red crosses
- Events: BDN fires (breakdown confirmed)
- **Interpretation:** Full structural breakdown, bearish regime active

**Result:** All four layers worked together to identify and confirm the top-to-breakdown sequence.

### Decision Flow: What Each Layer Tells You

**When analyzing a bar:**

1. **Check candle color** ‚Üí What's the current regime/bias?
2. **Check Pilot Line** ‚Üí What's the trend direction and strength?
3. **Check NanoFlow** ‚Üí Is there micro momentum aligned with trend?
4. **Check for event labels** ‚Üí Is there a trade signal this bar?

**Action:** Only take action on event labels. Everything else is context to evaluate signal quality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings (Configuration Approach)
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Configuration Options</span>

Minimal configuration changes are typically required. Default settings perform well.

**Available adjustments:**
- **Show/Hide Events:** Individual event types can be toggled
- **Colors:** Color schemes are customizable
- **Pilot Line:** Trend line visibility can be adjusted

Most traders maintain default settings.

---

## üîî Alert Configuration
<span style="color: #0aa1d5; font-weight: 600;">Notification Setup</span>

**Commonly monitored alerts:**
1. **IGN Event** ‚Üí Indicates potential long entry conditions
2. **CAP Event** ‚Üí Indicates potential exit conditions
3. **BDN Event** ‚Üí Indicates potential breakdown/exit conditions

**Configuration steps:**
1. Alarm icon on TradingView is clicked
2. "Pentarch v1.0" is selected
3. Event type is chosen
4. "Once Per Bar Close" is set

---

## Common Learning Points

‚ùå **Entering on TD signal alone**
‚Üí ‚úÖ TD typically functions as a warning signal. IGN often provides additional confirmation.

‚ùå **Overlooking CAP signals**
‚Üí ‚úÖ CAP indicates late-cycle exhaustion. Exit consideration is common at CAP signals.

‚ùå **Trading signals without context**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Higher-quality signals often occur at key support/resistance levels (Janus Atlas combination can enhance signal quality)

‚ùå **Trading without stop losses**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Stop loss usage is standard risk management practice. Signal outcomes are not guaranteed.

‚ùå **Beginning analysis on 1-minute charts**
‚Üí ‚úÖ Higher timeframes (1H or Daily) are associated with more reliable signals for learning purposes.

---

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions
<span style="color: #10b981; font-weight: 600;">Common Questions</span>

**Q: How often do signals appear?**
**A:** Depends on timeframe:
- Daily chart: 2-4 complete cycles per month
- 1H chart: 1-2 cycles per week
- 15m chart: Multiple per day

**Q: Does Pentarch work standalone?**
**A:** Pentarch functions independently. Combining with Janus Atlas (structural levels) or Volume Oracle (institutional flow) often enhances cycle event quality.

**Q: What performance characteristics are typical?**
**A:** With disciplined risk management and proper signal evaluation, traders commonly report 60-70% win rates. Performance typically improves when cycle events align with key structural levels.

**Q: Which timeframes work with Pentarch?**
**A:** All timeframes display cycle events. Lower timeframes (1m-15m) show more frequent signals with increased noise. Higher timeframes (4H-Daily) show fewer signals with stronger structural significance.

**Q: What timeframe characteristics exist?**
**A:**
- Daily/4H: Lower frequency, stronger structural significance
- 1H/15m: Moderate frequency, balanced for intraday
- 5m/15m: Higher frequency, requires faster decision-making

**Q: Does it repaint?**
**A:** No. Once a signal appears, it stays. What you see is what you get.

**Q: What if IGN entry timing is missed?**
**A:** Chasing entries after initial signal typically reduces favorable risk/reward ratios. Cycle events occur continuously across timeframes, creating recurring opportunities.

---

## Common Practices

1. **Higher timeframe learning** - Daily or 4H charts are often recommended for initial signal pattern learning

2. **Janus Atlas combination** - Signals occurring at key levels are associated with improved success rates

3. **Alert configuration** - Alert setup helps ensure signal observation opportunities aren't missed

4. **Partial position management** - Some traders implement partial exits at WRN while maintaining remainder through CAP

5. **Trade journaling** - Recording signal performance patterns can inform future analytical decisions

6. **Pattern recognition** - Complete sequences like TD‚ÜíIGN or WRN‚ÜíCAP‚ÜíBDN are often associated with higher-quality setups

## Quick Reference Guide

| Signal | Meaning | Common Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| TD üîµ | Early-cycle warning | Often viewed as preparation signal (not entry) |
| IGN üü¢ | Potential reversal up indicated | Commonly used as potential long entry signal |
| WRN üü° | Late-cycle warning | Monitoring typically begins, stop tightening is considered |
| CAP üî¥ | Late-cycle exhaustion | Often interpreted as long exit signal |
| BDN ‚ö´ | Potential breakdown | Often interpreted as exit signal (or potential short entry) |
